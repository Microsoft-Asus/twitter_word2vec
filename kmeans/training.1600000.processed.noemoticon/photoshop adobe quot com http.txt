I'm dropping Adobe AIR SDK and Twhirl for packaging. ELS doesn't seem to work 
@jenmeetdickens I have a similar Excel spreadsheet 
is trying to get Flash CS4 to work the way I want it to. Motion detection does not work and I don't know how to make Adobe AIR apps. 
I wish someone would update/fix WoW Model Viewer and the Map Viewer for Mac. They've been dead since before LK. 
@mlindqvist LOL I'm so sick of my usual editing techniques 
Kra, preciso urgente do Adobe Lightroom  
Why is Photoshop only letting me color certain parts 
Trying to upload a picture but for some reason I can't resize in iPhoto 
My Photoshop doesn't have the web photo gallery option 
Finally done now to wait for iMovie to export it... 17 minutes remaining 
Since this means returning an unsealed software, I am happy I got my money back! Thanks Magix, 4 me this means never ever 
Images you send from Aperture to CS4 that open in Camera RAW don't then seem to have their changes reflected back in Aperture. 
@gvwilson &quot;unit testing&quot; isn't high on the list of Adobe's goals for FlexBuilder and &quot;scriptability&quot; isn't something Eclipse is known for 
This seems a really good web based photo editing tool  from Adobe, no layers though   http://bit.ly/o2f4l
No more nice bright colors; No more greens of summers; The end of Kodachrome  http://bit.ly/k0aGy
Kodachrome is going away! I'm going to pick up a few rolls tonight from my local neighborhood camera store right now. 
@theorytree haha I work on a mac at my work exp but it is on its last legs  5 mins to load Photoshop 
Kodachrome is no more 
I really need to download the new Adobe but everytime I try it doesn't work  GOT to call my computer guy.
More advanced, or even advanced basic knowledge of Photoshop would help me out now. But i suppose Paint will do 
@JasmineNicoleee Yo no tengo Photoshop. I wish i did tho ive been wanting to make a banner thing. 
Kodachrome finally taken away  as time marches on the old and wise can get left behind  http://viigo.im/ZWa
I give up. Format c: 
@emilyspademan I clearly underestimated you! Comic life might be part of iLife then..shame 
Anyone using Adobe BrowserLab? I wanted to check it out, but it says they're not accepting any new users. 
I've been defeated by InDesign. 
I prefer Mindjet MindManager to FreeMind, boo 
Is there a software where my brush strokes will look smoother?  Adobe makes em look hard.
Basically my Notepad in my old KrazR had a lot of precious priceless spontaneous musings that I struggled so hard to remember &amp; now lost. 
@bibs4drips  i haven't even been in the chat lately! lets get back on track Edit!
Until I have my RAM, hard drive, and Adobe CS4 DVD, I can't do much productive with my new laptop since it'll get wiped soon anyway. 
wonders whether I have to use Dreamweaver for uni website 
Ah Adobe CS3, you were never given a chance! 
is soo boooored in graphics 
Is Dreamweaver a socially acceptable way to make websites these days? Or should I be using notepad? I don't know what counts as #geekfail 
My computer didn't want to let me use Lightroom anymore  So I'm making icons now x)
sitting in an InDesign class... enjoying it, but saddened that classes are coming to an end  2 more classes before I am done!
Unable to CAD today due to seizing up of back and shoulders. This is what happens when you don't stretch after you strength train.. 
I have a love-hate relationship with Adobe After Effects. Its actually more of my powerbook's fault. It's just powerful enough. (tear) 
@BlackMagic1515 :O tis all i know to 
So far kinda really liking Espresso over Dreamweaver. Handcoding html/css ftw

@whitneyhess reminds me of your &quot;emotional response&quot; point (deleting mails in Gmail), and why I turn off face recognition in iPhoto '09

@technex Adobe's just 20 mins from here. You want I should go smack 'em for ya?  
@mensoh show us the presentation, curious for the results of Prezi 
@MsInformation As a fellow Photoshop user, I understand what you mean. 
Maybe because this is the first time they worked on something like Visual Studio or wrote something real 
@inf3ktion That's a great idea!  maybe i'll try that out!  .. on a 4+ hour Photoshop session!! :-|
@neilhimself  The weird Coraline cover is the result of CMYK images sent on a RGB way, so it all weirds out.  Just open with Photoshop

@mandeewidrick  or try deleting this file to reset the 30 day trial  Library/Preferences/com.apple.iWork08.plist
@imnotteo I can't draw for beans, but I could go hunting for Soundbooth, Photoshop, and AE?  I can definitely afford those essentials 
@sylenc Not necessarily. You just need edit yourself little bit more carefully. Your dweets are entertaining 
Best Photoshop subjects are those that don't need any photoshopping. 
@djJlynn Ha! I'm not a gamer... CS4 is Adobe Creative Suite 4... photoshop, illustrator, flash, dreamweaver... the tools of my trade

@lisacall I did the same a while ago, but I got all finicky about the formatting in Excel, so it took me longer than 30 seconds 
I FINALLY got Photoshop cs3, thank goodness for amazing boyfriends and illigal downloads.

@brentoli yay for you!   I'm going out tomorrow night. I have the weekend off.!  http://myloc.me/1XMI
@gaufre I don't drink because of Photoshop itself. I drink because of editors yammering at me to hurry up. It's a science; it takes time. 
@Simon_Arenhold sort out your profile pic brother - nobody wants to follow a faceless person. Use PhotoShop if you're self-conscious 
Eric's &quot;learning Adobe Flex, day two&quot; log: um wow, Flash is very cool. I used Macromind Director from 1992. I guess &quot;lingo&quot; is long dead
