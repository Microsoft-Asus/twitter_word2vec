All good things must come to an end... After an amazing 15 week, packed run: Dracula is closing today. 
Wishing I'd said 'sod it' and was hanging with @The_Raff87 and @Slick_Ultra !!!  xXx
@hardertospell @apurplepatch I wants to be half way through Buffy.  damn other stuff that needs doing.
@orchid_slayer I'm very ashamed 
@pursebuzz Finally someone admits it! Storyline is unique, but once it was over I felt a little gypped with the casual/nonchalant ending. 
They should do a MacGuyver remake 
Aww, Terminator cancelled?  but at least Chuck has been picked up!
Just found out Terminator: Sarah Connor Chronicles has been cancelled.  Gonna cry myself to sleep tonight. 
HAha *Squid!* oooo. but ya im ganna try and get it figured out tomorrow im like freakin dieing without a phone 
The guy playing Gambit wasn't nearly as cute as I had expected. Gambit was my childhood crush. 
They should do a MacGuyver remake 
is going to attempt sleep while watching Godzilla vs. Destroyah *sniff*tear* the ending always makes me sad 
Fool that I was to expect a reboot proper!   But seriously, why the hell couldn't they have given us more Nero in StarTrek?  #fail
Really like the Universe Silverbolt. The robot mode has a really nice old school feel to it. Last Transformers Animated next week! sad 
Just saw the news about The Sarah Connor Chronicles  show being cancelled.  At least Terminator Salvation is coming soon..
Yay for Dollhouse and Chuck!!! Very sad about Terminator  
#Terminator #TSCC officially canceled  http://bit.ly/iG29E 
@stfuppy YES! everybodys like wait, do you have the old version or the scary version? the old one is tenx better!Depps scary... 
#Terminator #TSCC officially gone  http://tr.im/lDwW
Saw the cutest baby dragon today! It attacked us though, so we had to kill it 
Underworld:  Rise of the Lycans is okay...not like the other two 
: our budget - the horror movie that didn't scare anyone. In other words, Scream 3. 
@matthewfrancis I actually did today while I was in the work canteen. Zombie dog came out of nowhere. 
is dealing with robots 
wants to watch Jigoku Shoujo live action!! 
@JustPlainGeoff @tearsonfire @tianatweets @Loki_ZA I am not in the market for a court case  but it was a stupid issue on an old article
Sad day. Wolfram Alpha (were its creators Joss Whedon fans, or what?) no longer shows you profanity when you search for kittens. 
@m1k3y damn I wish I was at that @minm screening  Predator is awesomeness wrapped in shazzam
@Chinese_Ninja you turn into a pig. i had a dream about you guys last night! patrick shot a firework at me 
Missed a chance to work as a zombie. And zombie acting is my favourite. 
@overlordtrainee And at *my* Vulcan's expense?! Tsk tsk  #StarTrek
@joshourisman says some of the writing I'm editing looks like Frankenstein's monster made w/body parts of dead sentences 
I missed today's Shirt.Woot, with the DeLorean and TARDIS on the design.  Suckass way to start off a Monday.  
@roxybats I wanna see The Hangover, too! Except looks like they slam a door into a little baby.  Not funny now that I'm a parent.
So I'm giving in on my solo Christian Bale boycott  So much for my silly self righteousness.  I'm going 2 have 2 go see the new Terminator
Time to write my story about a sorceror named Goo, his army of Steel-Fisted War Apes... and his elabourate luncheons. In Arabic. 
Doomsday for me tomorrow after 6pm.. shit shit shit 
@Nixster27 Buffy Fest sounds like its just what I need cept all my Buffy friends are online no-one here likes it 
Frankenstein was a poor miserable character...I feel sorry for him 
Not happy that Terminator: TSCC was canceled.  But you win some, you lose some... Looking forward to some kind of wrap up on the DVD.
AHHH fucking work... I wanna play Devil Summoner 
Someone somewhere didn't like Panda Jigsaw http://bit.ly/RVyjl  
@naceprettub they should have slaughtered the Volturi at the end ha i cant believe the series is over 
I'm kind of not happy at the moment.  But Ferras album &quot;Aliens and Rainbows&quot; is awesome !
@Ides9 I just got pandora but I don't think they'll let me request a song 
@JillzWorth  lol @ Batman
Cabal doesn't allow conditional blocks containing an exe, that means it isn't remotely suitable for building test cases 
I just remembered something, I was watching Spongebob yesterday and I remembered someone I haven't talked to in a while. 
I'm scared that the next time WB does a Superman movie, they'll kill the franchise  I really wish I could pitch this idea to them!
@petertravers I can't wait to read your review of Terminator Salvation, I saw the trailer and it looked terrible 
@wideawakewesley But I'm looking forward to Terminator  say it ain't so?
I'm going to stop complaining about Terminator now &amp; go back to reading, but I am seriously disappointed in the way the series is headed 
@rishil I think I'm the bigger geek as I found that genuinely amusing  I LOLd 
@VVbrown i know...i had such HOPES for Terminator Salvation...but the reviews are all either bad or merely mediocre! 
Depeche Mode's Tour of the Universe in Warsaw is cancelled! That is so Wrong   http://bit.ly/sRaZb
@nonsequitir that's what I was afraid of. The trailer makes it look more like a monochromatic Transformers wannabe than the Terminator 
Ahhhhhhh Terminator Salvation comes out in 27 May in Indonesia 
I'm back at work with Mummy today. It's really hot  Lots of people in and out of office this morning. I get whiffs every now and then! x
Ocean Park was great  didnt play Dragon nor the Abyss tho  CRAP. 8 hrs of drama practice tmrw.. 8 hours of sittin there doin nthn..
Having a Bilbo Baggins day, forgot my handkerchief 
*weeps* they killed Terminator 
I cannot believe everything I watch has finished. Waterloo Road, Heroes, Supernatural, Stargate. Fringe/Reaper/Robin Hood only ones left 
Spock doesn't seem to like these biscuits! If he's not happy, I'm not happy 
And in other news, the new Terminator film is total crap  http://tinyurl.com/otukrm
Just saw a DeLorean on the way to work. He wasn't going 88mph  I submit it should be against the law for DeLoreans not to drive that speed
Fallen from second floor and have addres for 1 month 
@djaffe: very envious of your Terminator Slurpee. Something we'll never see here in Europe

*sigh* I miss Digimon Savers. Hell, I miss Digimon. AMVs like this make me miss it more. http://bit.ly/19R4LP  
I'm headed back to the office today, just in time for the entire crew minus myself to skip town for Sasquatch. 
just saw his #tweetcoding only boil down to 340 characters 
I hope my Terminator plans don't get ruined 
Starbuck's more of an all-around badass, but River's hard to beat when she gets going. (http://twurl.nl/gmo7p0). I miss BSG and Firefly 
Terminator Salvation doesn't sound good 
Sorry all hoping for destruction, but it looks like the Alien has died. Poor brown Alien. 
@ianwoollam apparently Terminator Salvation is shit  The kindest reviews say it's marginally better than T3 lmao
I was eating bread this morning really fast 'cause I was so hungry and I bit my finger  I'm such a Hannibal Lecter.
I want to see Terminator:Salvation but I'm afraid Christian Bale might yell at me.  
Bout to leave thorpe park.  Saw = fucking ace! &lt;3
@solitaireclay07 I'm still angry at them leaving Dobby out of the Goblet of Fire, and SPEW was one of my favourite parts. 
@Trogdor151 yeah, there were too many stories left to tell, can't fight cancer so well when it's in the bones 
@inell well... when evil villains and plots and subterfuges (which I haven't entirely worked out yet) are involved, not all goes well 
@creepy_doom ( . Y . )   or should i say...   | . v . |   
When is Phineas and Pherb gonna come back on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?  
@Elric521 Aww, sorry to hear that. Truly 
So Buffy is getting remade but without Josh Whedon.  Is this how my parents felt when one of the shows they grew up watching got remade?
@aka55 unfortunately I haven't perfected my teleportation yet 
Home after hanging out with Jesus. I'm having problems installing Majora's Mask on Wii

Sadness  The top horde guild that I liked disbanded.
Just saw a trailer for Batman Arkham Asylum and you can play as the Joker. But that's only PS3 exclusive. Damn  That hurt.

Ninja pirates 0-2  it's all good next game.
Illuminati rules..and that's not just Luciferian wishful thinking... 
Wish &quot;Cartoon&quot; Network didn't throw away Transformers Animated.  Talk about wasted potential.

@cghaynes Sammme!!! Just watching Batman then I may have no choice but to watch #bgt 
I have a dilema.  Curse my logic and morality, it's not steering me towards the fun option.  
And Bumblebee... is disappointing. I don't know if I just got a bad one, or if it's the toy itself. He just seems very poorly made. 
Zombie fun left me with a bad allergy headache from the makeup. 
@UcantEatshoes yeah it was Mask 
@kevinpollak why are you not going to be in the expendables? 
@autumnconfusion boo.  that's weird, its only on imdb. anyway, it's from a film called The Hangover
Cable TV was airing all three &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; movies and I missed the marathon 
Sometimes only one movie will do. That movie is Highlander and I can't believe I don't have it.

I'm dying a slow slow death right now  Hangover + no sleep + day with screaming children = dying
@bxbon We didn't even get option of 3-D.  But it was awesome in regular CGI.
I don't think zombies tremble... Or fear. 
Having a LOTR marathon...on my own 
So, pizza's on the way, and I will just have to watch TMNT on my own- no one contacted me about it.  Also watching Ghostbusters1+2 + Repo!
ROTF Bludgeon's wheels aren't stiff enough to hold the swords steady.  The swords droop down. 
Not feeling to good   I think I'm gonna take a nap with Wookie

@Suspenseful but... but... i don't like tumblr. 
Sorcerer with a spear + zombie = both take about 4 hits to make any contact at all...  sorcerers need they magic in DnD...dang I'm a nerd
I can't believe that Dragonball Z Season 9 is the last season. Hopefully, Dragonball will be on DVD Season boxsets soon. 
@tlcillustration Yes, Underworld looked supremely nice. Bad, wretched, horrible script, though.  Same with Coppola's Dracula.
@_veritas I wish we lived closed too  we need a drunken Clue party again!!!

@miasmacloud: Friend isn't enjoying the laggy layout and furry characters; and I agree with her. 
Slightly disappointed in Terminator 
Watching Merlin and I neeeeeed to do how! 
I've been in such a BLAH mood lately. You know that mood where you feel nothing? Not happy, not sad. You just walk around like a Zombie. 
@megannfifo 140 characters wouldnt be able to tell you how much i do miss you 
Just finished watching Valkyrie and it was a good way to wake me up !! Now I can't sleep 
I'm watching Saw 5 with the boyf. Makes me miss @likethedisease a lot 
I am not sure about &quot;Monsters vs Alien&quot;, but managed to fall asleep... 
Curse the recession period of today's society!! Can the world get any better than this worst-case scenario. 
i wish i could tweet past 140 characters
