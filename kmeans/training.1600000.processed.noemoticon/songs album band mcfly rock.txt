@YESandME ..i didn't know myself and was sending some really SUPA tweets to NKOTB and later realized...and had to unlock my account 
No used Mastadon or Propaghandi at Sonic Boom.  Joel Plaskett and Deftones will help ease the pain, though. As will their CDs I bought.

I just upset myself by looking at the Bonaroo set list.  I wish I could goooo.

Wanted to see BMTH but can't 
one week ago I was trying to kill the hours left to see Oasis, now.. i got only memories  but good ones, the best ones. 
ACDC announced their australian tour! Totally going to it.. shame it's not till next year though 
Gutted to discover that I missed two of my favourite bands at JBs last year; Eluveitie and Korpiklaani 
one week ago I was trying to kill the hours left to see Oasis, now.. i only got memories  but good ones, the best ones. 
I wish I could have seen Foreigner tonight. 
@twinatlantic awww I miss you guys  can't wait for you to come back with that album of yours!

Really shouldn't be youtubing recent NIN tour footage, it's making me depressed 
I am not a masochist but I was so obsessed with T. for so many years and this Mariqueen thing is upsetting me now 
I can't listen to this NIN music anymore.  It doesn't make sense to me if I can't have my fantasies 
@danlavie yet, there is a classic song i been trying for years to get my hands on...midomi failed 
is not wanting to start these essays  I'm downloading McFly songs instead 
im listening to 90's songs.. i really don't like this type of songs.. sware! 
nothing cures hangunders like a marching band... with drums... dressed as tulips. mwah 
I'm soooooooooo depressed I want to be in a band sooooooooooooooo badly.

I'm sorry for all those fans who will not be able to be NKOTB because of the cancelled shows

Ozzy's snoring. He NEVER snores! I hope he's not getting a cold. 
Enya is the most relaxing piece of shit music stuff ever. 
Never mind, the KROQ stream apparently inserts ads and station IDs more often than there are breaks in the show. 
I really want to go to Alesana tomorrow,, any volunteers? 
I have no  follwers  DEVO!!!!

elvis costellos new album is amazing!! now to do some revision 
and God knows how many more SingStar and Buzz iterations announced. Rock Band Unplugged to be awesome, OnLive to be absent.  #e3

Apparently Paul McCartney and Ringo are at E3 right now promoting the Beatles Rock Band edition.  NOW I wish I went.  
I missed all the Beatles Stuff  #XboxE3
@JenMilan720 you hated my tunes 
@DirtyWhoreleb i am guilty of bopping to both while driving though!

ive been listening to the same song by daft punk for hours now 
Wishinggg that I could go to CMA Musicfest!  bummer
@Mach712 Paramore lost to hana montana....yes...believe it..  
watching Pinkpop makes me want to be at Lowlands again  cannot wait!

kasabian advert... wish i was going to Oasis this weekend  kasabia and the enemy are supporting as well &lt;3
i hate band 
@hunz I think it would be freaking awesome if you release a redo album of old tracks. They are getting hard to find! 
Yay for missing Coldplay next week 
According to Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees, if it were 2 degrees hotter, here, we'd probably all just start killing each other. 
So I wish I could find all my Blink 182 cd's. Sucks the mark tom and travis show is scratched up 
Every time I get a text, why isn't it him, and why do I even want it to be? Band boys are so much trouble 
Starting to face reality. Wilco (The Album) is bad. With a few exceptions (I'll Fight, Wilco The Song and One Wing), it's their worst yet 
@Spoonsie DMB concert eh? You can't even use hotspot shield anymore as they found a way to block it 
 I keep posting songs here and no one ever listens (I can tell ;) ) - jeez it's tough being an unsuccessful songwriter!
@skybluesam86 No Muse. Bad Muse. 
@granulac The Beatles are lame

@mitchelmusso i won't be there cuz i'm in jersey  but i am totally buying the album no doubt! 
Oh shit I'm that douche that tweets during band sets   but I don't know them nor do I like them  srry
Sittin here bored ass shit at wrk.... ma tummy is hurtin so bad 
How could I have known at 12yrs old that this same song I was singing would later make me cry 
Sittin on the front porch thinking 
I wish Murmur had arrived today.  That would have cheered me up   I had nightmares all night about my beloved grandmother.
I'm getting pwned by Rhythmic reading exercises in compound meters. 
@Zakk26 It's never going to be over! this is the worst week of my life i cant wait till summer!and i have to record tomorow

DMB is stronger than they've ever been and that is fantastic! It's unfortunate it all had to happen after the loss of LeRoi... 
@lesmonitron haha - i'm realizing i'm not the greatest dmb fan... i only know the radio songs 
Sugarland, enjoy the ride: none. Rascal Flatts, still feels good: none. RF, me and my gang: none. all outta cds. 
@Jeneatha boo!! on you doing Mayhem and not Warped! 
@Starlsy they started making sickly girly pop instead of rock. i think they're still going. saw them at the now demolished waterloo.

@ambiguousaccent oh  whatever shit it is, I hope it will pass quickly. I'll be waiting for your result in getting me a Followill.
Really wish I could go to P!nk's concert  looks like so much fun!
@rlangdon  they have some good songs, not my fave band...
Why can I never write lyrics 
Sittin on @madsoli3 's floor w/ a bottle of sangria....she went to take babysitter home

@KatieCeciil What is your band you guys were so cute!! I had to leave early 
@fancy_pantzz Cutie left! I didn't even see him again! 
@SteffNasty I just heard a couple songs that made me think about that. It seems more and more are doing it but not all doing it well 
iTunes messes up the order of the songs in an album if you sort the songs by album. But if sorted by artist, it's fine. How inconvenient. 
Prayin my hunny feels better by tomorrow... bad weekend 2 get sick and I did it to him.

Wishing money wasn't the reason I am stuck here when Coldplay is on the other side of the country for the first time in years 
wishes she was seeing the Killers sometime soon  That'd help with the pre CAO deadline panic
@EllieQuinn I've been grappling with Abba-based puns for a while now and come up short 
The Kooks is gonna do a concert here but I live at brasiliashittown.  so, I can't go.
not all the songs on my playlist will fit on one cd!  but its 1.4 hours long so we wouldnt be able to listen to them all anyway. nvm

Why do I have these two ~5 year old Staind songs stuck in my head? They're so freaking good, but I wish 'Epiphany' wasn't so depressing. 
a recording just hung up on me... 
I don't know why I have favourite bands. I somehow am always incapable of being there when they need me   
OMFG, I wish I had been able to go to Bonnaroo.  Not to see NIN, but because Margaret Cho was there.

Not a good day at all...don't know how I'm possibly going to be able to work for another 3 weeks before Ibiza 
Kraftwerk was my highlight this year - still mad at the ppl that didn't &quot;get it&quot; and just stood there ranting about them 
@MDWarrior  if I were there, you know I'd offer every cartoon band-aid under the sun.
Soundcheck is done. 
@WilliamOrbit too bad madonna's &quot;veronica electronica&quot; remix-album never been released !

Awww, KoL is at the MEN Arena in Manchester ... I saw @NKOTB there.  
@KRoseL Liars are the worst. They're either afraid of the truth, who they're telling it to or they're insecure. No good either way. 
i'm getting bored by greenday's newest songs - what is happening?!? they used to be so awesome 
@DMB_ ooo good luck! you're already lucky that you've been on the beach for two weekends though!  i'm so jealous!!
