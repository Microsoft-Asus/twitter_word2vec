@g_wiggy Please tell me you're kidding. That must've been extremely fun. Rain and I had an HSM movie marathon today. We heart Zac, sadly. 
@kaisdavis Not sure about that game. ;) We saw Greg Lasswell. Pretty good, very mellow. Everyone was sitting down.  Which was weird.
Gah! We planned and executed perfect salutes as we launched on Rita; Queen of Speed, but the camera broke! 
Hmm,petted @Oliver_The_Cat and felt his bones entirely too much all over his body  eating habits still not good,hmm

I miss Jonathan From Spotify  he was my friend.
@Beth_Temple Yes, most of the cast have signed on to east transition to the new cast. I believe Cox is in full time. This makes me sad

@Alska @Andrea__P If I wasn't struggling to get my meds refilled I'd definitely be buying from you both. Disability doesn't pay me much.

Going to watch John and Kate Plus Eight with @lexxoutlive at her house (and hopefully @antonialfeo too!). I feel like I'm getting sick. 
@AidenStarr Since you never show me any love, Aiden, I'm not going to follow you anymore.  I'd have been a good long distance sub, too.
@Ambersaid OOOOhhhh... so sorry Amber.  It will be over soon 
Wishing my friend Craig would call so that I know he's OK. He takes the red line to work in DC 
Didn't watch &quot;Jon &amp; Katie Separate&quot;... and proud of it too.  Not proud though that I jumped on twitter to find out what happened
