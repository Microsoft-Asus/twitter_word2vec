@Bridget_D i hope so 
@Mommentator Awww, Molly  missing your babes?
bugger. Did want Yasmina to win, but had Kate in the sweep at work 
i am peeved that Yasmina won the apprentice  Kate shoulda won!
@benshephard Yasmina!!!  I was routing for Kate 
The first time my niece and nephew leave at a reasonable hour's when Caroline's excited to see them and they've already left 
Awww...I love Kate - she should have won! Yasmina is too sneaky 
@PeggyK1008 Amanda isn't done with school until tuesday and John and I aren't done until friday. 
Can't believe Yazmina won Kate so deserved to win  Kate and Philip do make a cute couple
@Sophie_Curthoys Nooo I wanted Kate to win 
Good on her - didn't really mind who won out of Yasmina or Kate but really sad that Margaret won't be back 
I just had to leave Maggie  But she seemed excited for her new toys and blanket!!
cant see Katie Curtis on the stage 
hey guys, i'm looking for my 2 friends, Sarah Bailey or fadeingout_starr and Heather Lasco i dont know her account name, i cant find them 
@Becky26492 i am jealous 
I spelt DONNELLY wrong the firts time then, and I suppose Ellie Donnelly doesn't fit, no matter which way you spell it 
@KirstieMAllsopp .....and she didn't even have the courtesy to spell your surname correctly Kirsty! 
Natalie hijacked my twitter 
@Jamie_Cartledge god damn Kate did not won  This is as bad as last year when Lee beat Claire
Katie and Peter split up, what kind of world is this

@MandyyJirouxx  my parents r cool 2 Mandy!! but sadly i don't know ur parents!!!! 
Going to pick up Jill now. I bet she looks beautiful. We'll probably never get back together.   Why do I bother?
@Wossy I think we're all saddened by the departure of Margaret!  glad Yasmina won though, is Kate fitter in real life? :p
@lindseywoerther If Katie continually interrupts the Tonys we're going to have problems. Safety is important, but it's theatre nite!

I really think I should get dressed and decide what I'm going to do today.  Debating about Curves - but Amy isn't here to go with me. 
I'm used to having the house to myself in the mornings before work. Now that Natalie quit her job, I've temporarily lost that luxury 
I miss all of my Thursday Meals Kitchen friends.  Mark, Erica, Nick, Sarah, Adam, Laura, Libby...I could go on. I miss all of them.
