@Jag999 oh crap, u're absolutely right! it's super hot actually..

I couldn't sleep thinking about the new iPhone ... I need it so bad !! I have the 3G but what the 3GS  what should u do !!

Last day in CO 
I am never around acomp during #FF! I always want to do it but its too much work from my phone! 
 no one responded to my meetup for breakfast this morning at Carls Jr on 2nd, oh well, I'll still go myself, only closer to 7:30.
@ianbetteridge firefox2, no idea what version of flash it is. i'd try to find out but FF just crashed. 
went to greenwich with friends and trying to finish my damn HW. there's sooo many! i have to log out now. 
sigh....i am home.  i have tons of laundry to do   hahahaha, it's nice to be back, but there's something about MD...hmmmm
@Tom_El_Rumi yes, but if he's inside &amp; AK is search/tracking PK will b found &amp; disappear.   protection important
gm ..my little twitter bugs ,,hot day in Tn today,,,watered the garden,,,didnt win the chair for fathers day  and watched the jo bros LOL

@MiMiD0LL did u leave yet? 
just realized I am going to one game for every series of the mets current homestand and in 2 (TB, STL) I want the other team to win. 
My iPhone 3GS is not out on the Fedex truck for delivery yet..... getting nervous 
I can't believe the 3GS has outsold the 3G on release day stats... Not with that pricing.. i would say #o2fail but clearly it is #o2win 
@manda903 We got both sets of parents a GC for a B&amp;B in PA for Christmas last year. Neither have been used, so I'm afraid of another GC. 
FP2 fried my brain a bit 
@sdanielleon and others!!    I just dont get it... why would you do that unless you are an investor at FF and wants to send traffic
FYI im not upgrading to the new 3GS because I'm not eligible  but it's ok cuz I can wait for video and a compass lol
