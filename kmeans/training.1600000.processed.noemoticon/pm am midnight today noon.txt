@opposable_thumb Over here it's looking like 3.0 won't be released until about 6pm-ish, so it'll probably be evening for you too 
flat viewing at 6pm. it's a pity, cause i won't be able to update my iPhone then 
@jmons nope, looks like it'll be 6pm then 
@JamieAudrey 1pm is the word on the street. 
Thinking that this is possibly the longest day ever!!! when is 5pm going to arrive seriously!!
