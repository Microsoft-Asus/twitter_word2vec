@mr_cf you know it how sad was I  but the new one has a balcony so watch out Egypt  if you see me on the tv arrested will u bail me out?
So, a recount in Iran. Hopefully it was the one scenario in which that will matter. Other forms of rigging will perservere unfortunately. 
@Change_for_Iran sorry to hear about kasra 
There is a highly farcical story of Robert Fisk and Reuters et al being banned in 1979 in Iran. As is happening now. Must re-read it.

@JustinAReeve yes, but this is exactly what's happening. they overthrew Shah 4 his dictatorship &amp;now Khamenei &amp; Ahmadinejad are dictators 
@61OH  It is to support a democratic Iran.  With all the riots and stuff we want that to stop 
@NixiePixel I wish I could stop president Bush from killing so many innocent people in Iraq 
Much as I would like to support democracy in Iran, I'm really not keen on that shade of green. 
#IranElection  Khamenei is so full of crap  Freedom of speech my ass.....
What are people in Iran saying about this? I have a strong feeling &quot;Change&quot; is coming...the hard way     #IranElection
Khamenei is indirectly blaming the deaths on reformist leaders saying they helped the situation!  #IranElection
@ Khamenei: boring speech! #IranElection I expected more honesty 
Ecstatic about the Pakistan win but bummed out about Ponta Delgada

i'm so tired, i had an exam today and now i'm going to a wedding party (in this situation) ad i'm so mad about Khamenei's speech 
The trouble with tweeting about-Iran: http://tinyurl.com/monc5k ?   Are we doing more harm than good? I don't know.  
The Ayatollah has spoken. All of your protests and anguish is all for not. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Iranian people. 
~ My hubby just shook hands w/President Obama and I didn't get a picture of it  - this definitely turned into a madhouse after his speech.
 It feels like I'm the only one who isn't green! Franky it's giving me a heeadache &amp; I wish the Iranians would sort themselves out already
can anyone confirm that Karoubi called for #iranelection cancellation, if only I had studied more Farsi

Shit is going down w/ Mousavi disappearing.  This doesn't look good.
I'm hoping that the news about Mousavi's arrest turns out to be untrue 
Currently in Texas going to Dubai then Syria. Cadegoestocollege is nowhere to be found 
Mousavi's offices are trashed, Mousavi's staff in police custody, Mousavi is missing. #iranelection #gr88  (via @ProtesterHelp) Not good

@R33S coverage on Iran. There are troops armed in riot gear in the squares where people had protests planned. There were raids last night 
Following the events in Iran. Bomb went off in Tehran. Peaceful protest getting ugly  Might give govt a reason to use force
Unfortunately, the reality is that without casualties it would be highly unlikely that the dictatorship and theocracy will be overthrown
