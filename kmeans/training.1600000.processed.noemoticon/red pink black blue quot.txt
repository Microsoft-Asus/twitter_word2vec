@Twyst The devil you say!  I've been waiting for the Black Widow in movies and now she won't be awesome at all. 
@Blue_Rose *hugs* thanks. I don't know how I'm going to fix this if I'm ever going to get my account back. 
@ThePaul it's a modded 360, so you can't send it back?  That Red Ring of Death sucks!  It took weeks to get mine back from Microsoft.  
Thanks everyone. Unfortunately nothing can be done. The sales speak for themselves, and if that doesn't convince Diamond, nothing will.  
also, Lipton's Sparkling Green Tea is gross 
@teamincredible ALL white shoes make me cringe  . White shoes give me pause.
