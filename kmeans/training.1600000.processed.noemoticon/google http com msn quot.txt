Wired mag needs to seriously chill out. I just renewed barely 3 months ago, yet they've already sent me 5 renewal letters for next year! 
Testing out Hulu desktop. Reminds me of a shittier version of boxy. Feels clunky, search is too hidden, the menu system is questionable. 
@bobbyshirley Anything is accepted except Christianity. Google the discussion thread &quot;sexuality and religion&quot; and SLED for Second Life.

Why does the cool stuff that Microsoft does never get publicity, while the gawd-awful stuff is front and centre 
if the Google Project 10 to the 100th is not discontinued? ??? 
Okay, I've changed my mind. I like the *features* of Bing, but the web results are still as irrelevant as they were with Live Search 
@Buzznet probably won't appreciate my opinions on that survey for the new Beta photo pages. Pretty much hated them.

i think i'm gonna try M$ Bing all day and see if i like it.  sorry Google.  
Won't be able to watch the Microsoft keynote until after work  staying off the Internet to avoid spoilers...
Why do people still use #MSN Messenger? It's such a pile of crap! It annoys me that I have to keep my account because they won't change

is anyone else having massive log in/access problems with Hotmail?  I can't even get a question posted to their msg board 
one hour till the MSFT E3 conference, I want it to be 1 already 
Sadly, I think that rate limiting will become a part of Bing, which will follow standard MS approach to capitalization  SLA 1.5sec/up99.5%
@KiroLM why did they wait till after I bought the first three games off eBay? 
@JacobLovie now I donno how to get there to see ya. Google can't figure out a route.  sadness

@LKJr In the midst of season 3.  I'm almost out of Hulu episodes!!!   I suppose it's back to surf the channel after that...
@genjones32 Agreed, too bad it's a money making machine that Microsoft has gotten the stuck in. :\ Bungie is a great dev though, too bad. 
I've tested Bing and I did not find anything special  One hint however: keywords in URLs are much more taken into account for the ranking.
@macbella2 Just sent the MAC Bible see if it works  Yahoo might not let you have it because it is such a big attachment 
Microsoft are doing some cool things with the Xbox 360. http://www.engadget.com/tag/xbox+360/ - if only Netflix was here in Australia
