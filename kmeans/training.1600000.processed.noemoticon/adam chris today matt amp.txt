my danny got voted off  WHAT THE F man!!!It should b Danny&amp;Kris.i no likey adam.Poo on him i still have kris but no danny. Kris better win
I knew it would be Adam and Kris but it still breaks my heart for Danny. 
@carlosfoxtv Carlos! Gokey's gone. Sad.    But Kris and Adam are both good! Kris stole my heart tonight!
Ugh kris is on the top. It shouldve been Adam and danny 
@osuvalpal It's Adam's looks that makes me go ech, tbh  He has a great voice but he presents himself really badly, imo.
@jwipe Idk about that cuz Adam even though his voice irks me he has a big fanbase that has carried him to the finals 
i miss my bro Adrian,he hasnt been home much  and then i miss Shay,stupid dork got her phone taken away now i cnt talk or txt wit her! :[
@melchelle880 I have to vote for Kris myself. I really really dislike Adam. Adam is nowhere near as good as Danny. It's a sad sad day 
@hulalah It's cos of little girls like u voting 4 Kris,tt's y he's in the finals. I'm so pissed my dream finals of Adam VS Danny is over 
@stonesimon Yeah me too like Greg and Producer Neil the most 
@hamishandandy thats it! i'm not putting my resume in any more. There is no point.  i'm going home. You dont even like me... do you? Andy?

Couldn't resist!  I had to buy Jaymie tickets to David Archuleta's concert on saturday.  she saw him on 2 shows today and she cried 
Jake's scared of the storm! 
Who is in SHOCK this morning?! Danny is gone - Kris and Adam are in the finals! American Idol almost OVER!  
Really craving riding/just being with Sam  and I want more pictures of us! I can never have enough!
Fuck yeah! Adam's through to the finals! Vote you amazing Americans...although I'm gonna miss Danny 
Watched AI. Gokey left.  I was hoping for a Kris-Danny finale, I just don't like Adam. Peace!
No! Kris is out of the trending topics  haha
im not watching the footy show tonight, cause i love Matty, and that girl is a lsut and channel 9 are homos for sacking him 
Danny.   Adam should win this. He deserves it more. I like Kris Allen, though. 
just dropped Justin and my parents to the airport... I hope I see Justin soon.. 
Soo mad danny left American idol!!!!  I was for Adam..I hate chris!!!! I wanted Adam &amp; danny to be the last 2!!...ADAM BETTA WIN!!!!!!!!
@gfalcone601 Kris &amp; Adam get through to the final lol  we get it here the same night as the USA&gt;
@dizzymisslizzie Yes, I did! I won a contest through my local radio station to go go-carting with them. Chris was sick so he wasnt there 
@kayten88 Adam should obviously win.  But how is Kris still in it??  It should have been Adam vs. Allison 
is is watching AI replay. Bye Danny Gokey.  and good luck to Kris and Adam.  http://plurk.com/p/trgqj

Missing Aaron like freakin crazy 
had to improvise for a plaster this morning.. and now Jake is laughing at me  tasteful! laughing at the injured
hope Sam isn't going home

One month ago today Justin was taking his stuff out of the house while I was at school. I came home to a note. 
@MattGiraudFan I envy her she got a tweet from Matt G
