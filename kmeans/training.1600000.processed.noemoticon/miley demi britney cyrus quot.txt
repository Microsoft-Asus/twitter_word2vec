I'm tired of &quot;Britney Spears sex tape&quot; and &quot;Hot Horny Kitten&quot; trying to follow me 
Cant sleep  but im thinking Perez Hilton and Lady Gaga would have the cutest baby

@momager2 I love tomatoes too, but there's no convincing him 
@Jonas_Dreamgirl omg that happens to me too! They've put too much crap that it's impossible 
So of course I'm laying in bed watching Tyra &amp; my tummy hurts 
@ddlovato Aww. Demi, will you please reply to me?  I really love you! You're the best.  I MEAN IT.

@TheRealJordin you tell 'em Jordin ;) i feel your pain sweetie.  ily. x
@WeSupportNiley Thats why im not getting alll my hopes up  because if I do and then find out its not Miley i'll be sad 
@desolate_pages *thumbsup* Ditto. But Trace Cyrus scares me.

@lelandgrant Hey man I wish I could go but I live in canada so I cant  let me know how the concert is and if Miley Cyrus sings or not.
Miley Cyrus s The Special Guest In &quot; Before The Storm &quot; :S 
@iheartmonster Maybe Paula Brancati... although she might be a little too old  Anyone other than Miley Cyrus is all good. #20BoySummer
@YuhmmMagazine Maybe it's that pic, but geez, Demi had a bad boob job 
I accidentally started to sing along to a Miley Cyrus song. 
Before the storm &lt;3 i'ts obviously about Miley 
@noahcyrus8 ya know, ive ALWAYS wanted to meet Miley. I think im just an ordinary girl that never would meet anyone famous 
@Covergirl1985 he pointed at me and told me to come down to the stage. i was like, &quot;me?&quot; but never did b/c of the chaos down in front. 
@Covergirl1985 i guess he moved on! i can't believe he he pointed at me!! i'm kicking myself in the ass everytime i think abt it. 
@Covergirl1985 i had boatloads of sharpies and i didn't go!!!! sad sad sad sad so very sad. 
@Covergirl1985 i know. i don't want to talk about it anymore. it's breaking my heart. 
Demi Lovato music sounds more and more like the Jonas Brothers' music everyday... 
so is anyone gonna send in a request to be in Demi's new music video? who's heard about it? i really wish i could go. 
@kidsinaustralia really ?  I just deleted some Britney video types today too 
My heart just broke into a million little pieces  thanks to nick Jonas &amp; mikey Cyrus! Has anyone else heard the clip of them singing &quot;BTS&quot;
Press all day without Demi 
@faniepanda I plan to, but must stay because Caylee is sick 
its bad that the same actor that played Selena's killer can't be in any other show/movie cuz ill think she's evil 
Demi's song &quot;for the love of a daughter&quot; sounds painful not as in bad cause it isnt out yet but i think it will be heartbreaking 
Ahhhhh, I wanna go see Miley in birmingham! But I'll be on my way to the airport when they go on sale. 
There's so many Fakes here from Miley...And this makes me sad  Miley i believe in you
My new housemate @DGPerth is forcing us to watch Kylie doing Dancing Queen

Scarlett is two months old today! Now we're off to the doctor to get baby shots

Wow, really? Chastity Bono is having a sex change? I'm so 2000 and late. 
@Magpie_Guy but I have no idea what I say to make that horrid Britney site follow me! But she keeps turning up no warning either 
and then a final one hour long finale. Miley wanted there to be a moral to the show so we'll see what happens. Personally, I'll miss it 
Ooh, almost forgot about my naughty dream about Lindsay Lohan last night. It was both sweet and sad, I was totally a rebound chick. 
&quot;My stomach hurts sooooo bad    now I have to follow some stupid diet to get better. Ughhh&quot;  -  I'm just like Demi !

@jamesmoran I certainly feel insecure and inadequate now that I know Britney is following other people to show off her fuckvids 
How can the Teen Choice people possibly put Miley Cyrus and Taylor Swift in the same category.  That's not fair to me. 
@DayDiaz yes!(: i didn't vote for Selena though cuz she was up against Demi,Demi deserves all 3 but i dont think she will get all 3.shame

@ddlovato P.S. I have to meet Britney Spears before I die.= or if she dies 
@tommcfly it's so annoying that you only reply to Demi 'cause she's famous 
@tommcfly I hate my life Tom! why you only respond Demi Lovato? Is unfair! I'm your fan too! I only wanted that you answer me, just it!

@oceanUP I'm still trying to get over Niley. I can't read a single gossip magazine w/ out seeing something about it. 
I realize that Selena won't come between them if she knows Demi is happy..but come on Sel...look out for her 
@rhymeswithemma Selena's 12, no? Her face is so young. I was just reading old blogs with &quot;sigh, N+S! Miley's heartbroken.&quot; 
Saying goodbye is probably the hardest thing to do. And probably the worst thing to do to.  Im going to miss you Malia.   I love you.(: &lt;3
@CoNvErSeGiRl365 ahhh i hate Trace for even posting that.he smokes and drinks and yeahh im sure he ain't a virgin /= SOOO wrong for Demi. 
@RobPattzNews It is sad that RPattz barely acknowledges the fans anymore, for fear of it getting out of hand. What's worse is he's right 
@Really_Brit  Miley put her Dad on blast and told him to chill on his tweetin. I felt bad for him!! Why would she do that. 
@jonasbrothers Miley Cyrus is not just a Honor Society friend, righ Nick? 
Wow thats...nice... And that video just gave me an irrational fear of Lady Gaga and accidental sex changes 
@AndreaVick oh  I still hope he's gonna sing as many songs as Demi
Bottom of the Ocean - Miley Cyrus &lt;3 the only song that I like from her, it's heartbreaking 
@alisabaez I don't like Miley.

@sammylee88 if you meet Selena tomorrow, have her call me yeah? 
@pattiB0i OMFG! Who's going to see Britney Spears in Australia? Soo jealous! 
I spent 7 hours (all night) telling Selena about my love life starting from February. I'm a mess. I'm sorry for keeping you up Selena

Madonna LV bag is all sold out..jkt..singapore is all d same..I'm too late,and regret it,I just wanna cry 
If I was a celebrity I would be papped looking like a worn out spotty Britney!  I am so tired and not able to rest   RUBBISH!
I am so mad Demi Lovato is coming to Connecticut today and I didn't know about it  She will be here live I am so sad :&quot;(

@mileycyrus Miley please reply me! that most important thing i wanna do is talking with you 
@jordanmccoy I'm tired and bored.  I need to do something exciting!  I thought GaGa's show would be it, but that turned out horribly. 
My platinum Miley World membership goes out in 3 daaays. 
@Craigfudge i'm not going to talk to Kellan anymore, I do look like a right stalker 
Awww Charice Pempengco's like crying on SNN!  I love her life story. Her road to Hollywood was like woah. Hardwork!
Heidi THS, MIT @ 10, attempting to retrieve my lost Britney files  and debating whether I should shower now/later cuz I have to work out..

I'd love to see Miley Cyrus in concert this November, but the tickets are like 80 bucks and I don't have a job  lol.
''YouTube is down for maintanance reasons andwill be back shortly.'' Grrrrrrrrrrr! I wanted to see Lady GaGa's new video

Britney Spears tickets are hella expensive. How will @samiiisales and I go see her concert now?! 
It's official: @samiiisales and I WILL go to Britney Spears' concert. I WANT TO.  Well, we still need to buy tickets. THEN it's official!
&quot;Wanted&quot;:  no human being has the right to be as gorgeous as Angelina Jolie; and why did they have to kill the innocent ratties?  
still checking Vogue to see if it will magically come back to life  
Apparently, the new Kylie Minogue album comes out next Spring. I don't think I can wait that long!
