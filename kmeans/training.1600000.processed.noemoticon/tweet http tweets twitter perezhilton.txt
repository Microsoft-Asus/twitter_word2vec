I haven't gotten any twitters since, like, one. Why ? 
@PerezHilton it was not that good  meh....
chely responds to twitters but not txt, i feel unloved 
@PerezHilton you should post what happened when you find out,  because I missed it, I was out of the room.  haha.
@PerezHilton It was after and looked totally scripted

@driveways if there are zan pix tweet them! I wanna see

can't verify my phone on TWITTER.  number+447624801423 ignores me. It's useless without SMS 
Why can't I delete a favorite? Clicked in the wrong place and accidentally made something a favorite - now I can't get rid of it! 
Its such a let down when your waiting for a message via text or email and the notification says (1) Inbox, but its not that  person. SMH 
Its such a let down when you're waiting for a message via text or email and the notification says (1)Inbox, but its not that person. SMH
