Trimmed the fat on Safari Sketch . . . runs on the iPhone . . . slowly  . . . time to optimize draw calls.

Why does Australia &amp; I have to wait until 18th June for IPhone OS 3.0  #notfair http://bit.ly/u4VVG
I'm told it's low odds that iPhone OS 3.0 will be available at midnight.  Source indicates mid-morning tomorrow (10-11).  Nerd bummer 
Just downloaded the tweetdeck app for iPhone just playing about now. Still no 3.0 
@stephendavis02 I posted the pics on FaceBook.  My twitter apps on my iPhone are not working  
@mashable I don't see it on the iPhone App store client yet though   Nowhere near my home comp either; ideas on when it'll show in search?
Twitterrific hasn't worked on my iPhone in 4 days. Anyone else have this problem &amp; a fix? 
cant find the #Tweetdeck app on the Store app on my iPhone ... 
Youmail android app doesn't work  I was excited to use it
Testing the app. It already crashed 
tweetdeck.com is down  I was looking forward to the new desktop app
TweetDeck for iPhone. The good: powerful UI &amp; price (FREE!). The bad: it crashes. The ugly: crashes a lot 
@padmeamanda I'm getting the iPhone 3GS. I don't think mines coming till Friday. I don't have a tracking number yet 
Ok, that's 2 crashes on iPhone TweetDeck. Waiting for the update 
Bad sign... My iPhone just froze after creating my #Tweetdeck acct to sync my desktop &amp; iPhone! 
I know is crazy but I want my Iphone JEJEJE and they had a trouble with the shipping and now I don't know if is is coming on time 
TweetDeck supposedly available for iPhone now, but it sure as heck ain't coming up in the Australian App Store. 
@RoyaltyGT I thought so too. The buttons still have prices and not 'installed' which has me nervous. I need to remember which apps r gone 
going to bed, and my new iPhone is still in the 'Prepared for Shipment' state.  perhaps the morning will bring the magic shipped email
The only thing Tweetdeck sync is missing is the ability to sync 'seen' tweets between the desktop and the iPhone 
@froogloid Hrmm.. I don't know anyone with an Android phone, so I haven't had a chance to play with it. 
@IntoMobile I deserve the iphone because I dropped my iphone 3g in the toilet in april &amp; cant afford a new one 
@MuscleNerd 
From a few tweets, it appears that Tweetdeck app for iPhone is a winner.  Too bad I have to get a Blackberry Curve for work.

iPhone OS 3.0 not yet available  The direct link to Apple is not for 3G (iPhone 1,2) but for 3G S (iPhone 2,1). What about the iPhone 3,1?
@pchille does that mean you have a first gen iPhone without 3G? 
Just trying tweetdeck for iPhone. It's pritty sweet. Crashed twice already tho, and no landscape keyboard  I think I'll stick with tweetie
Like the tweetdeck for iPhone  - can't sync columns ATM tho 
Tweetdeck for iPhone is still a bit buggy and craches when following links. Missing open in Safari button.  http://twitpic.com/7lye1
@stellakwok Will 3HK be charging extra for tethering with the iPhone? O2 will be. 
Bah, no joy making tweetdeck sync between my iPhone and desktop

iPhones, 3.0 OS released today, I am waiting for the unlocked jailbreak version.   I am buying iPhones, 16 gig, white ones only.
iPhone officially reserved. I'm sad to see my 2g go 
just got 3.0 for the iPhone.  I like the improvements but it makes me pine for the new hardware too.  No upgrade for me until Dec.  
Bad idea installing iPhone OS 3.0 with categories app 
iPhone 3.0 is great.  Now waiting for @meebo app for the iPhone.  Could not find any recent mention of the app online 
@wondroushippo well, see, my phone's not Jailbroken so I can't use it. 
Has updated her iPhone and is decidedly underwhelmed with new features. Very sad about no MMS 
yeay, just upgraded to iPhone OS 3.0 but not jailbroken yet 
Some nice stuff in #iPhone #OS3 thank god or #apple for cut, paste and landscape email without 3rd party software! Thought I'd get video 
Guess i'll worry about updating my iPhone later   I'm too tired to be worrying about it right now.
Will this iPhone 3.0 update ever end? It's taken almost 2 hours to complete and is cutting into sleepy time. 
Installed iPhone 3.0 update onto a 2G iPhone today, found Exchange server had OMA issue.  Grr. Need help fixing that.
Trending Topics are always on iPhone, Tweetdeck or AT&amp;T. Makes me want an iPhone 
A Not so positive report on iPhone in Korea .. sorry guys  http://adjix.com/g57h
@Bern_morley You bought a $133 iPhone imitation? Were you drugged? I was kind of hoping it really *was* thrown at a passing car 
Tried doing search on iPhone in inbox for text I knew was there (on server), and iPhone did not find it.   Maybe an update will fix.
the stupid AT&amp;T lady was right. i will have to pay full price ($599) for the iPhone 3GS.... yeah, not going to happen  My heart is broken
New iPhone OS is a huge letdown. MMS and Tethering currently MIA for AT&amp;T users. Voice control totally absent. Basically just copy/paste. 
Tweetdeck on iPhone is great but the colors make it hard to use outdoors   No way to change the colors? Black background - FAIL
After all day I finally got the iPhone OS3 update and it's pretty whack. Still no picture msgs  but I'm copying&amp;pasting all day bitches!!!
And of course the iPhone 3.0 tethering trick doesn't work with 1st gen phones.  I hope my copy of NetShare still works!
keep getting timeouts from app store  no new iphone apps for ME today
iPhone 3.0 sync'd all night  and then has none of my dev apps 
Damn. The SoftBank shop by my house won't start taking iPhone 3GS pre-orders until the 23rd! 
werkin' the new tweetdeck iPhone app, thought for sure I could type in landscape mode, guess not 
getting 3.0 for my iPhone...can't wait to test out the new features...too bad MMS isn't going to be working until end of summer 
Blackberry Bold or New iPhone. I don't know which on to get on Friday  haha
Got the new update on the iPhone and it erased all my stuff 
@maitri i don't know which of the thousand updates did it, but my iPhone can't see my music and my computer can't see my iPhone. no good. 
New iPhone OS was a long time coming. Glad to finally have a landscape keyboard though, twitterfon excluded so far. 
Disappointed (but not surprised) the iPhone OS 3 does not improve podcast support. Still no SUBSCRIPTIONS on the device 
Gah I hate numeric keypad typing. I want my iPhone back 
@RobertBlack tethering charges? - what is that? - never heard of that one before 
It's the updating iPhone firmware bit that always scares me... AND THATS NOW!! 
@sparkzrecords Lol. Haha. Dumb thing is though... 3G wont work with ur iPhone. 
@torifly Sorry you had a bad day  Snuggle up with your iPhone OS 3.0 and tech yourself to sleep.
My iPhone battery life has gone to crap after the 3.0 update and that's with push turned off. 
I need the new update for my iPhone!! 
anyone using Things on iPhone getting a hanging when syncing? It synce OK with Mac but iPhone then just sticks saying syncing 
@Rackor3000 Tethering prohibited at T-mobile, bluetooth was for me good enough... 
Witzig ist ja, das twittern und mail geht, aber websites und AppStore sind tod 
Hmm is it just me or is the (kinetic) scrolling in iPhone OS 3.0 much less fluent? It even stutters here 
@MuscleNerd EDGE 3.0 Activation?

I don't like how the #Groundspeak #Geocaching #iPhone Application continues to crash upon launch. 
Is sorting out his updated iPhone. Half my apps don't work due to a lack of jailbreak hacks and patches 
@TatesMan why dont you sleep with @MuscleNerd and leak us some ultrasn0w and pwnage! I don't wanna wait till friday 
If I do that software update on my iPhone will it wipe my music/photos/phonebook? Afraid

@Rachelers I love that u wooted your iPhone update then started talking about the mysteries of God; Pretty funny;I still havent updated

Holy Cow! The iPhone OS 3.0 upgrade wiped off all my existing applications. 
luvin Spotlight on my iPhone, now i dont necessarily have to organize my 10 pgs of apps ;-)  BUT sad i still can't get stereo bluetooth 
Argh! iPhone 3.0 is great but why won't voice memos sync with iTunes and what's with O2's extortionate tethering bolt on? 
I'm not impressed with iPhone 3.0 software on my iTouch. Not seeing the benefits and I feel that my $10 was wasted. 
is a little disappointed the first Australian GPS on the iPhone is $80 
Trying out @tweetdeck for iPhone ... groups are awesome ... Crashes a lot though  I'll stick with it for a little while. Wish: landscape!
@SamamthaSlopes - AT&amp;T not giving current users lo-plan-prices on new iPhones. 
So I updated the os in my gen1 iPhone and so far so good. Tweetdeck doesn't support the lanscape keyboard  oh well somthing for an update.

iPhone app keeps crashing on initial load 
&quot;Find my iPhone&quot; works well, but it's not smart enough to say which pocket it is in

What a bummer, CLLocation in iPhone OS 3.0 made the course value invalid for non-3G S phones   Gotta rework my app to remove that now 
@benhedrington Of course, giving the option to choose is a good idea.  In the past drop downs worked BEAUTIFULLY on the iPhone 
Apparently, you cannot send MMSs from the iPhone yet - AT&amp;T does not support it yet

Curse this pay-as-you-go iPhone... O2 won't let me trade in for a 3GS or anything

I was so busy I didn't even get to install iPhone OS3 today...getting jealous reading all the good comments

I've changed my mind iPhone OS 3.0 bites a big one! 
@sean2929 Yeah...can't buy iPhone apps without an AT&amp;T contract, so even if your phone worked w/ other service you forfeit the essence 
Stuck in traffic  should have rem I have an iPhone that will tell me things like this.
My iPhone software update didn't go as planned 
Just tried updating the OS on my iPhone. CRASH!!   Now my phone won't unfreeze.  great.  
most likely won't be getting an iPhone again.  None of my insurance will cover it and I can't afford a new pay &amp; go one.
I am so sick of the iPhone updates-I just paid recently for the 2.0!!! I'm skipping 3.0-$10 bucks here $10 bucks there. IT SHOULD BE FREE 
Ok no new iPhone 3gs for me fri. I will get mine in 7 days. 
Well iPhone 3.0 not particularly impressed more or less just like the last OS. Sorta dissapointed 
I am living in perpetual iPhone envy. I want my 3G S.

@bicoastalite Yeah, it sucks. But we've had the iPhone all these months without it so another month or so won't kill us I guess. 
Trying to sleep. Stupid iPhone keeping me up!  felt like a really long day for some reason :/

@Jonasbrothers the app never works for me 
@Kenny_Kenai you wish I could! But alas my poor 2G iPhone cannay send le MMS 
After a yr of complaining about cut/paste on the iPhone, it's time to complain about not being able to take video (not 3GS). 
Still don't qualify for iPhone 3G S $299 upgrade, this will be my first time not spending an iPhone launch morning with Woz and strangers 
updated to iPhone 3.0 - no push notifications, no tethering, MMS only for me.com 
Just bought an iPhone 3G S... For Jessi. I'll be 'upgrading' to her 4GB first gen iPhone for the time being. 
Me Wants Iphone  Nowwwwww
I noticed my little WiFi signal scouting app crashes under iPhone OS 3.0.  
@vodafoneNZ &quot;to maximise the speed &amp; performance of your iPhone install the latest free software...&quot;. I have no MMS icon 
What the heck iPhone 2.0?!?! Why won't you load the pictures/attachments in my (apple) emails? I'm getting blue question marks now 
I still have a first gen iPhone. 
So, after 24 hours with #iPhone 3.0, is anybody 'upgrading' to #3GS ? Still on the fence. #rogers will give me $250 off the 32G ($699!)  
is feeling a little traumatized by simultaneous outage of iPhone &amp; broadband..  Stealing neighbours slow WiFi feels dirty &amp; soooo slow.
I wish Apple would hurry up and approve the @Tweetie twitapocalypse fix for the iPhone 
@RoaringRepub The last week or so I've been disgusted with my AT&amp;T service, now not sure I want to get an iPhone and be stuck with them 
I just got the iPhone and I love it. I miss my man. He is in Cali for training. 
I want an iPhone but i'm on a contract with T-Mobile 
Can I not send picture text for iPhone update 3.0  someone help. Did I do this rite???  iPhone
I think I will hold off on getting the iPhone 3GS. Too many issues no MMS as per ATT and no tethering 
where is my #iPhone 3.0 video ? unhappy 
@RoneelPrasad yup I work till 1830, I work M-F, man I wish I'm off 2moro, dat way I don't need to deal w/ iPhone 3Gs inquiries 
getting annoyed at the Beejive IM spinning wheel of death. 3rd reinstall in 3 days? When will 3.0 hit the iPhone app store? 
Love the &quot;Find my Phone&quot; feature of the iPhone 3.0 software. I could have used that last summer when my iphone 3 G was stolen. 
Ugh, my left iPhone earbud just went dead.  Replacement is $30. 
Loving that the new iPhone is has so many new features they can charge for 
Just sold my G1 Android. Should I get an iPhone 3GS or Kindle DX? Both are sadly locked devices 
Restoring iPhone to factory settings.  All my apps are gone.  
What's the difference between sea salt and gourmet sea salt?  Boo, iPhone 3Gs launches tomorrow   Sucks to be working for ATT now...
 I went to update the OS on my iPhone and my whole phone had to be restored!!! I finally updated it on my pc instead of the laptop...
Kind of depressed that I will be waiting until December, when I can upgrade, to get the iPhone 3G S 
Fido.ca is not only useless but ugly.  Any deals on iPhone for existing but non-iPhone customers? Tired of my z710.
AT&amp;T pricing for the iPhone is a lot better than $800 fees here in Australia...  iPhone 3GS is not worth even more money!
So WTF is going on AT&amp;T ... I can't get my email via iPhone, texting is lagging. Is it the MMS thing (don't know what that is)- Help!  
My iPhone says I can't drive anymore.   http://yfrog.com/08gwej

@rob3988 thanks for the apple link rob - still no outlook notes syncing on Office 2007 and iPhone 
@tweetdeck great App for the iPhone but it crashed everything 4 to 5 minutes!  
@razorianfly I'm not because I'm in Finland and they don't know what an iPhone is over here. 
push for iPhone in Italy is a pull service!that's so bad for the batteries (less than one day autonomy)... unusable  os 3.0 not so useful
@peirix my MMS ain't working either  maybe i can only send it to iPhone users
@DonMcAllister And no news on the pricing of the new iPhone neither 
@openville but then I'd have to install yet-another-app

Another hour passes, still sitting in my car... Great way to waste a day.  no exits, no movement, just 3FM (radio channel) and my iPhone.
Updated my iPhone to 3.0 software. I had to a hard reset  but everything was backed up  Wife's iPhone took 10 mins, no problems!
Curses, work haven't had any pricing info on the iPhone 3GS yet, was kinda hoping I could blag one, but I suspect it will be costly 
Someone in my office has picked up their new iPhone 3GS. I won't be able to upgrade until next summer

So jelous of everyone who is getting the iPhone 3GS today! Wish I had the money for a PAYG one

@sarahjpin @warrenbennett I've ordered a T-Mobile G1 Android - it should be here today, but not arrived yet. 
AT&amp;T is expensive. I can't let my iPhone go. 
No ATM card... No new iPhone.  or at least no point in standing in line at 5am. I'll have to go to the bank. When they open. At 9. 
@andrewmilton a vanishingly small fraction of the cost to me of a new iPhone which is around 500 quid 
@O2 Can you guys give me a free 32GB white iPhone 3GS please? My contract doesn't run out till Jan and I can't afford the PAYG one  LOL
There are going to be alot of iPhone 3GS videos today. 
@MuscleNerd it's so hard to be patient  I hope you're not wasting time on things like sleeping! The people need you!
@emmerinc completely agree with your conclusion. And i miss the email/open URL in safari very much  #tweetdeck iPhone
Updated iPhone, restored backup and now I am syncing my apps back. Could take all night 
Argh, I honestly think they would have ran out of 16GB White iPhones by now 
@bratcat76 that wil work. That's what I was thinking about doing. Remember iPhone requires a dataplan 
Iphone 3Gs launches today!!!!!  I won't be getting mine for a few more weeks!

@Just2Stressed I will not buy one as long as the IPhone is tethered to AT&amp;T. I'm not techy enough to jailbreak one, either. 
@MarkStokes iPhone 2G users cannot use MMS without the app, iPhone 3G users don't have much use for it / us now admittedly 
Ugh have to pay for the iPod touch OS 3.0 update. And iPhone users don't have to pay!!

Disappointed by the Palm pre battery.  There's no Iphone killer...

Got a Nokia E71 as a replacement device for a couple of weeks...  My iPhone is broke down right now 
Why can't I download the new iPhone software!!

Okay I'm promising my self I won't buy the 16gb iPhone I willy only buy the 32GB when I can spare500$ if not I'll wAit until feburary 
Thinking of getting the n97. Definitely not getting the iPhone though (can't). 
Being on an unsupported carrier with iPhone is a BIG hassle. Took me a while to get tethering to work and  MMS hasn't work yet. 
Thanks Tekzilla for reminding me about the #squarespace iPhone giveaway. I think I forgot yesterday 
Turns out the new iPhone isn't as cheap as I thought it was going to be in the uk. 
@selyod check out iPhone dev blog redsnow for windows is out which provides similar fubctionality to quickpwn doesn't work on 3GS though

Pardon me while I shill but I am totally enamored with the iPhone Bump app ( http://tinyurl.com/djocfb ).  That no one has 
I really wish my work would allow me to use an iPhone instead of a Blackberry.  I'm itching to get a 3GS going... 
@zbender Facebook iPhone app is a disgrace! Still not updated to reflect changes to the fundamental service from last year. Grr. 
My new iPhone 3G S is surprisingly already on its way - but I'll be in Basel the next 3 days  Patience required.
@scurker I was about to recommend you give a try MediaMonkey &lt;http://www.mediamonkey.com&gt;, but it doesn't sync iPhone 3.0.
