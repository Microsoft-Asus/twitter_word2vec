Sympathy to those affected by the Washington DC train disaster 
@nbonsack I think I rode the red line a couple weeks ago while I was in DC. It's kind of scary to think about that. 
Hopes all our friends in DC are okay, and sorry to read about the subway crash  http://bit.ly/SLYm9
good gracious.. subways are not supposed to collide  Prayers to the injured and casulties on the DC Metro
@Babbano DC. One went over the other one. So far two ppl have died. 
http://bit.ly/Xfr3y two confirmed dead in the #DC metro collision 
The red-line (DC Metro) subway/train cars that crashed--sounds like it was at or around my old stop #TakomaPark 
they're saying that the trains were inbound to DC, so they wouldn't be as crowded.  I guess that's something.  
I can't help selfishly hoping that neither my cousin nor her husband are in the DC metro crash  I should feel bad for everyone
My thoughts are w/everyone in DC. I hope everyone is ok, I rode the red line pretty much daily, it's a scary thought.  http://bit.ly/S3rUb
