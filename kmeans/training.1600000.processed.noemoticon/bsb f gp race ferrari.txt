Not many people from my home town using IRL connect ... 
...well I was going to RPM. Vespa needs oil, I ain't going anywhere 
strange start to the #f1 season. Brawn 1,2 in australia, abandoned race in malaysia and 0 points for ferrari so far 
@fairminder Audi A6, fender gone, insurance claims it was a $3000 damage,  and the Merc I hit even more 
Almost finished Lego Indy - but have been grinding the last 2 achievements for hours 
i wish there were more people that i know IRL on twitter....lame. 
@orangy68 GP ?? but honestly what are you doing ?? all that good work getting your body clock round to normal time ruined 
@nick_carter you and BSB just took a nose dive. 12 years of my life wasted. Disappointing very disappointing 
watching Chinese GP...only on TV 
Alonso is too light 
@AustGr3m 7.10am now, starts at 8am. Better than the aussie GP for us, I was up at 5am 
Up early to watch the GP today. Dodgy hamstring is still dodgy, so I wouldn't have been able to run this morning anyway 
I shoukdnt haven't taken that deep walk in 'em heels!!! I twisted my weak ankle aGain &amp; now I'm huSTLin' beHiND the BAR on a liMP 
Chinese F1 GP starting behind safety car due to rain 
Race started,leader is The Pacecar  #F1
Bad start to Shanghai GP today 
Oh no, baby's awake. There goes my F1 watching. Yet another DNF 
WTF? Massa is out again. Ferrari is having a really bad start to the year. And he was doing so well 
WHAT is going on with Ferrari?! I am LOVING F1 2009.....but.....it's still not the same without a certain MS  #f1
#f1 So, another good race for us tifosi then 
Button missed corner  #f1
looks like Ferrari will still be pointless at the end of chinese GP 
Glock overtakes Kimi - it just gets worse for us Kimster fans 
Ferrari pointless again. sad face  #F1
@surfnutt would be nice to see another Vettel win, but either way I won't see it cos about to go out now 
Button losing the lead  #F1
Tweeted to soon as S Vettel takes the lead from Jenson. 
@Pinot007 not watching today ;(  not home.. Used to support Honda, he he. But I'm also big fan of Kimi! Not very fond of Hamilton, sorry 
Kimi has been passed - his laptimes are shocking 
@welshrob87 yeah he was unlucky at Monaco too 
@Schofe yes what a shame, Sutil is usually good in the wet 
@kimifan Thanks, it was nice even though I missed the race coz of it. Looks like i didn't miss an awful lot though, shame about Kimi  x
Pity about Sutil and Force India though 
disappointing results again for the Ferrari Team at Shanghai... 
Sutil missed a golden chance  again. No points yet for Force India. Ferrari is the only other #F1 team without point in 09 
Kimi overtakes two cars in the closing laps but its not enough - he finishes 10th with no points 
another sad race 
Wasn't a very exciting race  but hell yes for Jason Button and Brawn GP.
That was an amazing race! So happy for Vettel and Webber, but also heartbroken for Sutil and Nick. Poor Nick  #f1
Well that was eventful. W/D to Vettel, but very disappointing that Sutil and Force India didn't get sixth. Big shame  #f1
Formula 1 was fantastic this morning, I really enjoyed it. I'm so happy to see Redbull taking P1 and P2. I was sat to see Sutil wall it. 
Formula 1 was fantastic this morning, I really enjoyed it. I'm so happy to see Redbull taking P1 and P2. I was sad to see Sutil wall it. 
I shouldn't go out late on a Formula1 weekend  (Although good on Vettel!)
Button finished third. But he got more points than when he finished first on Sepang. Hmmm, better luck next time. Kimi = 0 points.. 
@jongulergrey IRL mod privs revoked 
I am such a fucking failtastic IRL friend. 
Bloody internet has spoiled the GP by showing me the name of the winner before I actually watch it 
Kimi looks like he has much more fun at races than me     http://ow.ly/3eVk
@Kathrynelle I felt sorry for Massa, he was up to 3rd before his problem! He was quicker than Kimi and Hamilton aswell 
The zip is broken on my wallet. I need a new one. Ferrari don't sell that type any more though 
@maureenoconnell Briton has a lot of things, but sometimes I think talent is a rare commodity

Barrichello to win the #f1 today. I really want Kubica to place, he's a fantastic driver. Damn, why can't I watch it. 
Watching the GP, enjoying the sun, doing revision 
Watching Formula One, and my fave driver got kicked out in the first lap. Not happy! 
interesting race today. Drivers having different amounts of fuel makes it interesting! next year isnt going to be as good  stupid FIA

Pettachi wins! Cavendish 2nd 
@henweb the Peugeot is an ugly car 
Barrichello should have won, it was his race 
Felipe Massa(Ferrari) so unlucky in Spain GP, goodbye Ferrari, there's no hope in this year. 
Really wanted good ol' Rubens to win the Spanish GP earlier!  Still disappointed for him! Soft spot for him, he's so lovely!

Racing suspended for now at Donington, torrential rain, thunder and lightning 
Ironing done - Turkish GP in 40 minutes - sky getting dark again in this part of the world  
another predictable result in Formula 1 
Approx. 2 hours lost so far at Donington, we'll be here till 9 at this rate 
At the after-hours GP  Things are not good.
@jimbofin auwww  what did GP say?
Time for the grand prix now, go Button go. Hope mark webber has a good race too. Silverstone next, if only I had a ticket 
Button or the Cheeky Vettel for a win today, and Apprentice this evening! Margaret's curtain call 
Barrichello shite start. 
Kimi goes to 7th 
Atrocious start for Rubens tho  #f1
So much for Rubens' win 
okay, Button is really pulling away now. 1.5seconds ahead. Hamilton down again to 17th. 
Beeb not showing in car footage on iplayer.  RB stuck behind a Kers car. #F1
watching Formula1 on Television...shit...Sebastian Vettel is not the leader anymore 
oh no Fisichella #F1, not again 
Kers really is pointless  #f1
Doh - I spoke too soon, Barrichello makes contact with Kovalainen as he tries to pass - he's back to P17 now   #F1
settled down with roast chicken and the turkish grand prix. gutted for Barrichello 
is gutted for Barrichello in the Grand Prix.. Bless him 
@Kat_LB I have a feeling Vettel is going to get him! 
The Turkish GP is not going too well for Kimi  hmph
just saw Rubens trending, don't be confused art people - apparently he is a racing driver   - (does he like size 0 as well?)
Ferrari still not on good level to compete with the Brown Gp in Turkey 
Hamilton overtaken by Piquet - that's a new low for the 2008 World Champion  #f1
@tarasis I thought it would be better when Vettel had a chance of passing Button but it's become a bit of a chase-the-leader race now. 
Another disappointing race for Ferrari  .... I don't know what is wrong with Kimi's car
~shakes head~ it seems the only thing Barichello is capable of leading is the twitter trend list....come on Ferrari. I miss Schumi days 
@tasha_pencil It's so boring that Brawn &amp; Red Bull *cough*Button*cough* are dominating  I'd prefer Ferrari winning over them tbh
I was hoping to see a Brawn lapping a Brawn  #f1
I should be happy for jenson winning really but.... meh. too annoyed at Rubens. 
@aulia no I'm watching live, I'm just a Rubens supporter 
@Jamesallenonf1 This has been the most dreadfully boring race.   #F1
Yay Button! But i'm slightly pissed that Barrichello had to retire.  #f1
It will be another win for Jensen Button. Alonso loses 2 places from the start if he finishes 10th.  #f1
Podium. Button - 1st Webber - 2nd Vettel 3rd. Massa's 6th.  Raikkonen a disappointing 9th. :9 I think this season's already set. sigh. 
As predicted, abandoned at Donington, too much water running into the dip at the tunnel 
This maybe will be the last Formel 1 season I follow. Boring and disgusting. Ferrari Fan 
@ironmanj AM texted me. Not a good race for him then 
What a shit!! they are broadcasting Formula 1 instead of French Open men's final!!! I'm so angry!!!!!!!!  How can I watch it?((
@Marutib F1 is no longer any fun  .. I hate Brawn GP!
@alandavidski Yus. Most definitely. I'd love to go to Silverstone but it's so damn expensive  I used to hate Massa haha not so much now!
another great win for Jensen and Brawn GP.  Sadly McLaren keep going backwards 
Enjoyed the Grand Prix. Vettel didn't seem too happy though 
Ferrari what are you's doing! Another bad race 
#f1 Ferrari seemed lost, no gains  *sigh* surprised by Brawn's first failure, but it's still Button-domination #maxout
Always happy to see Jenson is front, but it's a shame Seb lost it on the first lap. He was obviously disapointed on the panel 
Button makes it Boring.. 
Most depressing race ever 
Kimi didn't even score a championship point  i thought he has a good chance of getting a podium finish after Monaco's result buhuhu
@iGraves I do all my emulation on a GP2X -- which I didn't bring. 
watched f1, great race glad for Jense and rosberg, gutted for vettel and barrichello, so heartbreaking seeing rubens crying at the end 
Got no revision done 2day  ,, French Open  Turkish Grand Prix  Federer  D-Day  Sims 3  Rubens  Button  Vettel  Rove  Barrichello
@Strathchaileach yep it was great domination by Brawn &amp; Button :-D I'm so gutted not to be going to Silverstone this year 
Noticed #barrichello as a trending topic (Rubens Barrichello, the Formula 1 driver) but most posts using that hashtag are not in English 
Rabobank was invicible in the TT today 
missed watching Turkish GP.  . Button won again.
@kayels quali was great in end but race was a real shame for Kimi  Fingers crossed things are on the up though, luck &amp; performance wise
@allstaralice IRL she's gonna be gone for a week

Formula 1 will be different next year, now that the 8 FOTA teams start their own championship. Sport and politics 
@regzcervantes  I don't have favourite BSB or NSync songs, sorry 
Up at 5:45 to find out that F1 is in disarray... what a start to the Silverstone GP weekend 
had some bad news one pf the sponsors i was hoping for for the Dakar '10 couldn't make it work 
@sportycarrie wow - wish I was there, missing Silverstone for the first time in 5 years 
Last day for FIA and FOTA to come to some agreement, otherwise F1 will feature only Williams, Force India, Manor, US F1 and Campos teams. 
FOTA teams intent on starting their own series. Will Max and the FIA finally listen or are we looking at one big lawsuit; Politics 
What are they doing to my Formula 1 
My beautiful car has been sold.  My new one shall be a Lamborghini Murcielago! http://bit.ly/14X46s

@Sant61 no pics  but someone must have made some of me riding Zandvoort with the deep-red sunset... anyone?

Formula 1 championship in trouble   http://bit.ly/2hBtTN .. on a +ve side, Force India (Mallya) has a good chance!
As I'll forget later...Good luck to Jensen Button and Lewis Hamilton this weekend! The last F1 race to be held at Silverstone 
@emilyjayneimage lol, so am I! They don't let plebs like me in the paddock 
@cjdurham Nascar is wank...I do like my right turns in motorsport. And hell yeah I miss those games - not played tennis in yonks 
Formula One won't be the same anymore.  And I blame both FOTA and FIA. Classic ego clash.
#inaperfectworld There would only be 1 championship, and the FOTA teams wouldn't breakaway from the FIA 
My boss is away to Silverstone this weekend and I am so jealous - wish I was there 
\\suberbikes are in Snetterton this weekend! And I'm not going!!! 
@EternalEden we don't have Physicians Formula here 
With heavy heart, and I've avoided it all day, but can avoid it no longer  time to google Formula 1 news.  
Just realised, weekend at work is going to mean I miss the Silverstone GP  Going to have to stay off Twitter and watch on iPlayer!
Oh dear, preparing to head to Silverstone in the morning (hurray!) but it seems I may have caught swine flu...not feeling too well 
I'm sad that Formula 1 isn't what it used to be

Watching Speed Racer and wishing it was just like old times. 
watching the Qualifiing for the British #GrandPrix at:  http://tinyurl.com/lbtmhm - preamble nattering at the moment 
@abbybradz  I will miss your tweeting, and I will miss saying horribly inappropriate things to you IRL.
British F1 Grand Prix tomorrow at #Silverstone, should be a good race. Sucks for Lewis Hamilton though, his car is just not good enough 
I've been thinking, where have so many of our FakeF1 drivers gone? I miss @fakefelipemassa 
Bugger. Hamilton 19th when Q1 red flagged. Why's it always McLaren? 
Bad accident for Adrian Sutil during qualifying session for British Grand Prix. 
wanna be at Silverstone  #fb
Massa   Very disappointed. Come on Kimi! But being realistic, I hope one of the Red Bulls takes pole #F1
can't watch British GP 
Unfortunately the lanyard does not have a Silverstone ticket attached to it 
damn. didn't know that Speed Racer is at 7pm, huhuhuh .. gonna wait for tom. so i can watch it. the craving is killing me .. 
Shit!!! Shit!! But happy for Redbull.. Hahaha..  Vettel in the Pole, Barichello 2nd and Weber in the 3rd.. Oops, where's Button?? 6th!! 
Jenson's 6th 
I hope Renault haven't done their usual trick and fueled Ferni light  Also, I cant see Jense being that far off, fueled heavy anyone??
Vettel on pole.. Raikonnen 9th - Wake up Ferrari 
sux that Button didn't get pole or even the front row, third row may not be good enough for a win. Please let F1 and Silverstone live 
Sad about Jenson Button AND the Lions. 
@ozmusiq hamilton in 19th for race 2moz, Vettel on pole. Wtf hamilton 
Another drivers ed 
red bull start 1 /3... bari @ 2nd.... Ferrari's fall back again..  9 /11..
He's def getting in with the FIA  guaranteed himself a job for at least 4 months there.... http://tinyurl.com/kk749u
im at silverstone ouut side a burger van eatiiin a burger... this is the lyyf! yessss Sebastian Vettel got pole  yay xxxx buut im am cold 
i'm not happy, Jenson and Rubens have the same amount of fuel and Rubens did so much better. bad day for Jenson 
Jenson Button down in 6th for the British GP tomorrow, ouch. Things aren't looking good for a Brit to win at home tomorrow.

No sun in GP today!   I was really hoping to be by the pool all day!!
Sold the Honda, I kinda miss it  lol
Interesting evening of old-school Formula 1 documentaries on channel 116. Depressing how high the bodycount was 
seems updates from my phone wont work  boo... i got to meet Kimi Raikkonen today... im on cloud 9 and he is better looking in the flesh!
rave gig at the Button Factory + too many shots = headache. paying the price for my first guilt free night out after the LC 
12 Sprint Cars were kind enough to grace us with their presence at Springfield Raceway for the ASCS Sooner Region race. 
Hoping F1 sort  out their differences and sort their shit out, imagine no F1 at places like Silverstone, Imola &amp; Monaco. 
I miss being in Indy with all of my favorite people.     Can I go back now?

Today's British Formula-1 Grand Prix will be that last race at the legendary Silverstone circuit. 
Right on cue the helicoptors start going over my house on the way to Silverstone  8 on the dot
A lot of raining in Misano.. 
I can hear the GP2s going round but can't see them 
Watching GP2, still hates it that there is no channel on TV showing anymore it and that I have to watch it on a crappy Stream online 
is waiting for GP - what a silly fracas - and all cos mosley is a twat 
@sofiaescobar It must seem really sad that your WSS tour is finally coming to an end....      What's next for you?!
sore throat.. ahh...  #BSB
I wish I was at Silverstone. 
I wish I was at Silverstone.  #f1
Looking forward to the #F1 British GP today. Not looking forward to having to stand next to @FakeEJ for 4+ Hours again 
Looking forward to todays F1 race, even though Button's not starting at the front of the grid... 
Time for some lunch and then home for the GP. Branson has said Virgin won't sponsor Brawn next season 
Morning - no lie in today, relentless helicopter flights overhead going to Silverstone from 8 am 
Is getting comfy for the British Formula 1 Grand Prix. Last time at Silverstone. 
First time in years that i've not actually been at Silverstone for the GP  . Still, I'm sure I'll be there next year. #F1
settling down to watch the last Silverstone ever... It's the end of an era 
I hope Alonso doesn't leave 
Vettel getting a good lead +4 over second... jensons down at 11 under 
wtching formula 1 - Button nt doin 2 well 
20 seconds down and losing hope  BUT theres 48 laps left. maybe Vettel will crash?
*watching British Grand Prix* Button doing very poor!  and Vettel is flying, bad times!
I'm watching the GP of Britain Silverstone, maybe this will be the last F1 Season  
Watching the Silverstone Grand Prix, The Brits are quite dissapointing at the moment  Early pit stops have started so who knows!
Seriously the new TT Tour is so great!! Wish I could see them!! 
Webber doin okay, but seems nothing on Vettel atm 
@CHRISDJMOYLES WTF have Brawn done toJjenson's car? It's like he's trying to drive a shopping trolley 
Fisichella in 10th place in british grand prix .. 
@fennyfenn_ not really what i was hoping for for Button  you having a good day? at your Dads if i remember rightly
Meh, Button in 8th now 
I really want to be in the race! It's so cool and much more giving than skydiving! But I know I'll never be capable of it 
We made home just seconds before British GP started, but it's not really going the way we were hoping 
Not looking good for Lewis and Jenson in the British GP 
Well it could be worse - there are at least World Touring Cars and Superbikes on Europsport 
There will be no British National Anthem at Silverstone today 
Shocking British F1 GP for Button &amp; Hamilton .... 
it must be a dull GP if the tv is focusing on the back of the race 
Jenson not enough laps left to get and overtake Rosberg and Massa.  #F1
@marco_cali Webber is doing so well. Race is a bit boring though.  @rhettroberts
boy, did i pick a race to back Button...that's 10quid down backing a British victory at the last race in Silverstone  Well done RedBull
Massa was brilliant today. Wish Barrichello had cocked up 
just 2 points for trulli  #Silverstone
awww wanted button to take rosberg on final lap  #squarespace
Vettel wins at a canter from Webber. No last lap heroics like last week's #MotoGP  #F1
#Vettel has wone the F1 Race, congraz! #Button only on 6  NEXT F1 STOP: GERMANY YAY!
Vettel did a really GREAT job!! i feel happy for him now. bad day for alonso, though 
Such a shame about Jenson  but well done to vettel webber and Barrichello
No British driver on the podium....now that suxs 
Is this Silverstones last F1 race event? I hope not! 
@gfalcone601 haha Hey, you were watching F1 at Silverstone? nice race, but Button didn't win in England! Bad times..  Xxx
Ferrari @ Silverstone - Better luck next time 
Ahh man, Jenson Button! Really wanted a win from the man. 
#F1 #BritishGP - great display from Red Bull and Vettel today.  3 week break now until German GP at Nurburgring 
Just watched Button lose the British GP 
is thinking the #F1 was a great race. R.I.P Silverstone 
So thats if for Silverstone then, no more British GP there or will it? Goodbye Silverstone  
Also can't believe that this race may have been the last at Silverstone, where F1 began 
@clairabellejp allegedly Stiggy is going to take his helmet off tonight.   I don't want to know who he is!

Packing up for the trip to Ascari track, thank you Bacardi 
Didn't realise Kimi opened a Ferrari store in London, I need to go see this at some point 
Jenson Button is gonna win today. And haha your all hungover 
As the race starts, lots of talk about Massa being in P4 powered by the KERS. Let's hope it comes of good help to both the Ferraris  #F1
@remzology Amen to that!  And now to look at Kimi catching up on the lead pack. He has a faster car than most in front of him  #F1
Come on Brawn Racing! 
Taking out the Evo for a spin at 8:33 yaaaaaaa!! 
Kimi busy with the interviews - no time for icecream yet!  #f1
things are flying off Massa's car 
Massa is just a bit annoyed on the radio  #F1
@Sp4rkR4t it was Trulli, he has (had?) a house down the road and runs in the local half marathon. I also like him as he's nuts!  #f1
Button, contender of championship overtaking Hamilton, current World Champion. Fun sight 
Button, contender of championship lapping Hamilton, current World Champion. Fun sight 
To all pilots: make sure you have enough fuel in your tanks today  #f1 #Massa
Canceling a purchase of a Ferrari. Ferrari is a @#%&amp;*#@!!!! I'll not buy it anymore.

@suziperry thanks suzy for another great weekend of MotoGP really enjoyed, Mr Edwards is such a sweetheart 
@suziperry Re Toseland, good performance, hope for more. Given a top bike, I'm sure JT can be right up there like Button in F1 with Brawn 
@WilHarris But the Focus RS is only FWD. An Audi or Scooby STi with AWD is a lot more fun, and safer. 
what would you say if we talked IRL?  would you just come up &amp; start promoting stuff, no chit-chat first?  then don't do that on twitter. 
@fashionherald Indy500 isn't Nascar...it's open-wheel racing
