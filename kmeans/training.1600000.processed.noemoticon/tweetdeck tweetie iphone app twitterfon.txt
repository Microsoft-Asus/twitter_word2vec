I feel like I am the only &quot;twitterer&quot; not on TweetDeck. 
Btw Eventbox is available for free on Macheist for every visitors. Unfortunately I switched to Tweetdeck  http://macheist.com
@TweetDeck Can you not become a seperate program rather than use AIR? AIR is awful and this RAM leakage is bloody annoying! 
Nambu getting some good reviews as an alternative to TweetDeck - sadly Mac only 
TweetDeck crashed again  I don't think it likes Vista64
can't get TwitterBerry to work 
@inside_out I do have TweetDeck, but it seems to crash my computer every time I use it. 
@lisaturner I'm ok, thanks so much for asking  Sorry I can't respond to DMs atm - darn TweetDeck is playing up 
@SarahLWLee  awww but I like TwitterFox! I really like TweetDeck as well. It runs with Adobe Air #wowroom
If my replies are slow or I miss them, please be patient with me. They are not showing up on TweetDeck. Having to scroll  #frinightfever
ouch following the #ASOT400 in TweetDeck exceeded my Tweet limit! 
Just installed TweetDeck, and man i can see why people use it! But how do i load all my tweets? 
Where did my last tweet go?? It was from Tweetie. 
Um, Tweetdeck is being difficult for me.   Farmers Market today though!
@dremin I want to find a Twitterific alternative, but not many sit on the menu bar and leave my dock uncluttered. 
TweetDeck keeps crashing on me  Writing my next blog post, will be up in a couple hours.
Anyone else having issues with the latest Tweetdeck patch. I'm having trouble with profiles and links - keeps crashing 
Anyone got TweetDeck_0_25.air on hand? Tweetdeck's site is totally borked, and I need my fix. 
@TweetDeck 
I want Tweetie, but I don't have an iTouch 
@TweetDeck what happened to the unread tweet counter? That was one of my favourite features of tweetdeck. 
@lostinmiami That's odd, because I use TweetDeck just like 97.3% of Twitterers... 
TweetDeck is not working properly for me 
@TweetDeck I'm hoping a new version will come out soon that doesn't crash every 20 minutes for me. 
I thought Tweetie for mac was meant to be out now?! 
Living without Tweetdeck is like trying to make sense of word vomit. I want my laptop back. 
Trying Twhirl on Linux, seems working fine, but TweetDeck is not 
@ejacqui Tweetie doesn't scroll to the top 
It turns out that Tweetie-without-ads is NOT free 
First impression on Tweetie 4 Mac: Fast, I love the &quot;conversation&quot; UI, well done! But I love the groups and FB plugin of TweetDeck. 
@chrisbaskind @momsbunnies where did u guys get #Tweetie. I still see the &quot;coming soon&quot; video 
I'm trying out Tweetie for OSX.  Pretty amazing interface but no groups.   That's one feature that might send me back to Nambu.
Tweetie won't open on my mac 
So Tweetie is pretty cool, but needs moar Growl 
@ghawi I'm back to buggy Nambu. Tweetie needs sound/growl support before I can use it full time. Also, no persistent searches. 
@adamdrago Tweetie will beat Nambu pretty soon I think. All it needs is saved searches and groups. Nambu crashed all the time for me 
@bolognahead but I already paid $3 for Tweetie. 
@hdbbstephen Unfortunately I can' tload Tweetdeck on my work comp. 
Tweetie does nothing but bounce in my dock and disappear.  
the downside - Tweetie for mac; you have to be running Leopard   note to self, upgrade
#Tweetie for mac is awesome, the best twitter client by far, where is the missing client for Linux 
Tweetie for Mac seems slow on updating posts, I feel people are tweeting faster than this is updating (nothing in 10 minutes+), API limit 
trying out Tweetie for mac. pretty sweet, but an unwanted distraction. probably won't use it all that much. 
The Facebook Gadget of TweetDeck is quite cool. But it does not update replies 
@TweetDeck also it sucks that I lose the API call counter when I make the windows 2-columns narrow 
Tweetie is the most beautiful twitter app, but functional? Not really  No faves, no growl, small compose, no customizing, ... #tweetie
@jarrardcole And so--the battle goes to Tweetdeck.  A slick, animation-full interface and threaded DMs and Conversations is no Groups. 
Huh, my TweetDeck seems to be missing some of my friends' tweets 
Attempting to use Tweetdeck...but my rate limit is exceeded. 
Aww man...TweetDeck is already down to 15/100 requests left...and it doesn't reset for another half-hour 
was toying with the idea of trying out Tweetie, then realised it's OSX10.5 only - 1st time I've been old my os is too old 
Tweetie iPhone app has Twitter Trending - desktop doesn't seem to.  
Trying out #Tweetie, very nice UI.  Looks like I can only have one profile/account open at once though 
Tweetie wouldn't work for me yesterday  - now it is and I can defo see what all the fuss was about.
wishng I could use Tweetdeck or Twirl but sadly IT won't let me 
Tweetdeck isn't working. 
Wow. TweetDeck is interesting. Too bad I've got a headache right now.  I'd tweet more but I'm still busy with things on the journal sites.
@mydc probably 'cause you updated from txt? mine updates on time from TwitterFon ga wor... 
I miss TweetDeck 
I can't see John's Tweets on Tweetdeck or the Web 
Missing TweetDeck coz my 2nd monitor decided to die on me... Somehow i feel like i'm not completely utilizing TD without my 2nd monitor

Wow twitter clients e.g. Spaz, Twittie, UberTwitter, TwitterFone only allows u to send 100 tweets an hour 
Arrggh... One network down so can't use TweetDeck. Stupid Web-interface 
TweetDeck throwing fits all morning. 
@crimsoncup for whatever reason, seems to take a couple of days for Tweetie to get the avatar updates 
#Digsby just crashed for the first time

Why isn't there a BlackBerry app for FriendFeed?  http://myloc.me/12Ff

Tweetdeck fail. 
@TwitterFon And I *hate* Tweetie. Sorry, but I think I'll keep my Beta Copy of TwitterFon Pro... 
@dhruvasagar Twhirl annoys me with the multiple windows. 
@TwitterFon what's happened to the &quot;show conversation&quot; with @replies ?!? 
@DHughesy love my Tweetdeck........it start to control my life tho

.@nik_kee_dee .@fjkinnit i did over 8000 tweets with TweetDeck before it died!!! i loved it SO 
Why is TweetDeck not working anymore 
@lindsayevans I don't think Tweetie likes your profile pic either 
TweetDeck is really cool and I do like it but it's a memory hog  80mb? yikes!  I am closing it now....
@ms_genevieveah. yeah tweetdeck is intensive. i can't use it and play my pc games   I've tried Twhirl too
@ms_genevieve yeah tweetdeck is intensive. i can't use it and play my pc games  I've tried Twhirl too.

I hate TweetDeck when it reaches access limits 
@Blinkollieb182 : nooo  i don't know why...i click on TweetDeck_0_25_manual_Blink182.air and it doesn't run!! so sad...
I think I might like Twiterfon better than Tweetie now. Recent upgrades from Twiterfon have been great! None from Tweetie 
My TweetDeck is languishing in API Hell. Again. 
Just updated #Tweetie and open in browser is still broken. 
TweetDeck is acting really strange! Hum........ reinstall maybe. Update on the horizon? Or is it just another Adobe memory leak 
Hm... TweetDeck has lost all old replies. 
I wonder why thumbnail pictures aren't showing up on my TweetDeck? 
@tchetelat Not as much as I did with Tweetie. It didn't jive with me, which is why I looked at Tweetie. Can't use either now, no iPhone. 
@marshallsheldon Probably not a good idea, its hard to tweet on the web, I miss Tweetdeck!  *cry*
TwitterBerry hates me 
I'am back to Tweetie 1.1.1. 
Tweet! Just uninstalled TweetDeck and Adobe AIR until it decides to work again. 
Tweetdeck down for the night 
I usually have 8-10 columns going on Tweetdeck at once. Trying to figure out how-to on Seesmic. Columns overlap when adding columns. 
TweetDeck is starting to become a pill because of the limits set. SO I go back to twitter to continue on till my API resets, 
theres something wrong with Tweetie 
update of Tweetie... still no sounds  #tweetie
Ahhh... Tweetie just crashed... And I am going back to school in under 24 hours... 
Neglected my Tweetdeck for a couple of days. Sorries. 
Just discovered Tweetie. Looks great but doesn't integrate with Growl like Nambu does 
#TweetDeck STILL won't let me direct message someone who is following me...so, so annoying! 
@BElanna_Torres @_HarryKim OOC: I can't see it on Tweetdeck, or on the web 
FriendFeed is down 
@CLG_CND I actually love TweetDeck...it is my internet connection that is the problem 
Now on TwitterFone. Tweetie aint working. 
My Tweetdeck has gone on vacation. If you happen to see it, tell it to come back already. Sheesh!

Tweetdeck is not working !!!  tweet later  !!!!
TweetDeck having trouble connecting to the mothership. 
Tweetie's url shortener is broken 
@aral they have to stop making ads so shiny in Tweetie. It has come to the point, I consider buying something through an ad in Tweetie.  
Re-downloading Tweetie, pictures jsut aren't coming up on it! 
Using TweetDeck and yet my tweets say they are via web. Wow.  Does anything on the internet work right? I still have no user picture. 
Tweetdeck is acting wierd. 
Why in the world are all tweets now saying &quot;from web&quot; even if it was from my app? I love Tweetie. It should say from Tweetie! 
Not liking how the latest version of #Tweetie changed the highlight color of tweets.  It's really hard to see when things are highlighted 
@dickiemaxx  seems alright.  It seems like Friendfeed integration isn't working though. 
I think Gtalk posting functions are down right now 
I dont't understand Tweetdeck 
@jjsevier Your photo doesn't work on my Tweetdeck 
okay trying Seesmic vs Tweetdeck and all of it's flaws, gotta get used to this one, and I miss my pretty colors 
angry because TweetDeck stopped responding, so i ended it, and now it won't open but if i ctrl+alt+del, the exe is still running 
Oh no i accidently tweet 2 times haha don't know how to delete a tweet on TwitterBerry 
@sweetsofgeorgia TweetDeck has been fine for me. I'm having problems with iPlayer Desktop 
@schaeferj89 It says I am from web and I am using Tweetdeck too  Silly twitter needs a smack lol
Tweetdeck makes me sad 
@ckipe I definitely agree that Seesmic Desktop (and TweetDeck) suck up a massive amount of CPU and memory 
Finally got round to using TweetDeck today.  Pretty happy with it so far but not able to use at work unfortunately 
had nice sunny run! hmmm TweetDeck has an annoying I-want-to-shut-off-bug... 
misses Tweetdeck &amp; must wait until she has her own work computer log in before setting it up. 
@kamaelian I have a worried feeling that Friendfeed does that for all posts, even the short ones.  I might be wrong though.
@PammaApple dude idk why it does that, lmfao, you and some other person told me i replied to myself, Tweetdeck is doing that to me. 
@seismic007 i know...! and i used to be so in love w/TweetDeck... and then we just kinda drifted apart...  i guess we cld alwys try again
Is TweetDeck being ridiculously slow and starty-stoppy for anyone else? 
is anybody using an api (apart from TweetDeck) to aggregate tweets? My TweetDeck has fallen over 
@EMFK Seesmic Desktop is hiding you tweets from meeeeee.  So mean 
Does TweetDeck not minimize to the tray?   Perhaps I should go back to twhirl...
OK, I'm totally in love with Tweetdeck after using it all weekend on the desktop, but of course I can't get it to install on the laptop. 
@beansbaxter Been using Splitweet, will look at Tweetie. And yeah, a couple of things aren't working quite right since my 10.5.7 update 
Shit I don't have wireless so have to wait till tomarrow . FUCKKKK!  so now iam twittering from my TwitterBerry.
I changed  my password and Tweetdeck is not accepting it 
If all they typing I was doing into Tweetie was going into Scrivener, I'd have this document half-written by now 
Got fed up with Twhirl taking so long to enter text, so trying out TweetDeck. Looks nicer already, but still not Tweetie 
@JaeCy09  What do you do? TweetDeck won't let me view your profile 
On TweetDeck, looks like I cannot set my bit.ly settings so I can track the number of clicks in my acct, eh? 
I think my TwitterBerry is broken 
ampf! i can't use my TweetDeck. 
@sundemon10 How did Tweetdeck work on Linux?   or 
@mr_billiam @sammutimer That's the biggest pill with TweetDeck, the API. Just as I get into it...it exceeds limit. 
@PaulaBruno TweetDeck is slow tonight for me too!  #gno #GNO
@nine43 yes apparently you can use TweetDeck and still get through, no social networking for you 
@brushbox problem with delete seems to be at my end...bl**dy Tweetdeck 
TweetDeck doesn't support Chinese... at all. 
@winchester_syll Doesn't seem to show location on Tweetie

Tweetdeck has given up on me  I think thats my cue for lunch
#Snaptu just went down for #maintenance. I hate tweeting from m.twitter.com! 
Hey, my TweetDeck doesn't want to show anything, I was using it but now all groups are gone, &amp; just a black blank deck. 
@timmoon_cs boo why don't your tweets appear on my Tweetdeck anymore - I thought you'd fallen out of the Twitterverse 
Tweetdeck crashed...my pc thinks its working and its 'tweeting' but i cant access it 
Wondering what happened to my #Tweetdeck notifications, was missing out on a few things 
From webinar: Seesmic looks like another good Twitter interface...but Tyndale's IS dept. only wanted TweetDeck  #CisionLive
hmmm  my @replies aren't showing up in the replies column in Tweetdeck  
One think #Seesmic doesn't seem to have is the buzzing right now column. 
My regular chat friend is out with his friend. I'm feeling lonely on GTalk  I need friends, like me, who don't have a life beyond the www.
Oh how I wish the customizations I make to TweetDeck follow me around.  I don't feel like re-creating all the groups I made at home 
problems with TweetDeck 
is going to miss Twitpocalypse because of summer camp 
 My pic isn't right in Tweetdeck after all that trouble of getting that pic up, and few people will ever see it as it is meant to be seen
Okay Tweetie Pies, I will NOT be tweeting as much until my BlackBerry forgives me. I don't know why the trackball has given up on me 
@ranivus TwitterFon and Tweetie are the big 2. I was using TwitterFon because it was free and ad-less. But now it has ads 
@PepperTheDog i iz gud Peppah - just trying to figure out how to get back into Tweetdeck. i don't like to twitter on the web. 
Tweetdeck was insisting that even tweets without '@' in them were unable to be delivered because 'recipient not following you'.  
this TweetDeck is still going crazy... 
@rgoodchild The last search I put in TweetDeck ,now keeps tweeting a result every min;&amp; I can't get rid of it no matter what I do  Also..
@NadiO_da_Model I told you that TwitterBerry sucked!! That's why I like UberTwitter so much, I had TwitterBerry the majority of the time 
@BengeeB Morning!!!  I booted myself last night...; )  too much alcohol &amp; #FF ... TweetDeck was flaky...  
@denimmafia The new Twitterific looks nice, but you can't see your followers/people you follow! 
Oh hey, I passed the 1,000 mark 17 tweets ago. Disadvantage of Tweetie: can't see your stats like that. 
Friendfeed is down again. 
Ooopss! Friendfeed down  http://yfrog.com/11vsmj
I like Seesmic desktop, but it's installed on a work comp - when i connect to the work network, seesmic works.  At home, it doesn't. 
@TwitterFon keeps crashing 
After changing password, how long does it take for Tweetdeck to use my new password? locks me out with old one, doesn't accept new one 
UberTwitter acting up 
how do I enter the ampersand (at) sign on TweetDeck when 'shift 2' is a shortcut to those that I follow only? grrr.... 
Trying Tweetdeck on windows xp but can't install it on my vista  anyone can help?
I keep trying to get the neighbors and Bree to use Tweetie because it's just so much more functional. They refuse to pay any amount. 
How does one restore the &quot;All Tweets&quot; default column in TweetDeck? I closed it, and regret doing so now 
Twidroid let me down  back to good old twitteride..
@SashaCTLC aww  I wish I had my TweetDeck... I'd look for that tweet and repost :'(
damn, TweetDeck just crashed for no reason, hope it doesn't happen again 
Tried both Twhirl and Tweetdeck. Much preferring the former (cleaner, less invasive interface). No longurl API support in either, though 
#f1 my avatar hasn't updated on Tweetie 
All my friends disappeared in TweetDeck! Coommmme baaaaaaack!  :::::
My Tweetdeck seems to have a mind of it's own today and keeps disappearing from my screen 
Foolin around with TweetDeck and tryin to decide what to do since its raining outside 
Twittelator is failing me and not being able to access twitter.  sadface
Not nice TweetDeck boots you if you have more than 100 msgs per hour 
Tweetdeck has been glitchy lately, 
Why would they put the little x directly above the up arrow on the scroll bar on TweetDeck? 
My Seesmic just ate all my memory.  #WTF
@ms6cr8ive they fixed the free twitterrific, not the premium one yet.    back to using Tweetie for the time.
I miss my Twitterrific app 
Tweetdeck about to boot me 
@Tweetie  no OSX 10.4
Twitterrific is suffered from the Twitpocolypse 
Twitterrific is suffering from the Twitpocolypse 
I hope the minimise to tray feature is restored on #TweetDeck soon 
@sigitt - Maybe  *sighs* TweetDeck acting funky too.
#TweetDeck refuses to remember what messages I have marked as read. Every time I restart the application, they're all unread  #fail
The update of TweetDeck has done more damage than good 
Uhm, this TweetDeck update, there's no more tiny icon on my taskbar? 
Twitterific was down 4 3 days!!!!! 
I miss Twitterific 
@georgiaarnold how awesome! just an fyi, when clicking on link to UberTwitter we can see the picture but not the google map... 
So, #TweetDeck was updated to fix a crash, to do so they removed the minimize to systray, which totally blows 
Twitterific stopped working so I'm using TwittedFon until it's fixed. It's poo  off to play minigolf!
I have 2 twitter w/ TwitterFon now that Twitterific is down. TwitterFon sucks. 
New #Tweetdeck update stops Tweetdeck minimizing to the notification icon bar 
@thomas0811 Tweetdeck was te langzaam met refreshen

Twitterific, why did you stop working on my phone 
Twitterific is soooo not anymore 
twitterific on the ipod touch/iphone still doesnt work due to the #Twitpocalypse  
@BevaniteEllie - Has Twitterific started working again then? I've been stuck with TwitterFon all weekend 
Twitterific is not letting me login 
Why does Tweetdeck hate me?  I did the update like it wanted! What more can I do for you, Tweetdeck?!
@mrtaikandi But I'm addicted to TweetDeck's columns 
I've managed to fuck my computer right up, mostly fix it and go to insanity and back. Tweetdeck's broken too. 
@chadfogland @jahlschwede But Tweetie still has some unfixed bugs. I'm still apocalyzed. 
@theiceangel But Tweetdeck doesn't have that.... 
#TwitterFon was draining my iPhone battery 
Twitterific is down 
@JasonArmistead Received many shoutout for Tweetie.  But I have a blackberry   I love it other than for using the Web
@travisloh Then what requirements you got there to install Tweetdeck? My AIR file is damaged when I download the file it says 
Ever since upgrading Tweetie to latest version, clicking the hashtags doesn't load up the search term anymore 
@ljharris: I can not see the pics you are posting, as I have no Friendfeed acct. 
Wow, I learned the hard way that there a bunch of Friendfeed regulars who are really hateful/judgmental and the like. 
@Vegasseven I was wondering how long it would take for them to get to it. Eh. I can't see anyone's face  (in Tweetdeck)
@PersiaRose I know what you mean, whenever I get on I rely on Twitterific to catch up, unfortunately the Twitpocalypse took it out 
troubles with my TweetDeck  some replies that I saw I received just dissapeared before I answer them!!! don't you hate when tech fails?
Twitterific=not working 
Twitterific seems to be being a shit head    http://bit.ly/5kDld
@juliaroy My @TweetDeck won't minimize to the notification area any more after the update. 
@LtGenPanda Use #Seesmic desktop instead 
Rearranging my @TweetDeck groups. @mixero had failed me dearly. 
my ipod touch app &quot;Twitterific&quot; isnt working 
@teganann Do you have the same issue? With the cursor all jacked up when typing? Went back to TweetDeck but REALLY loved Seesmic 
@TweetDeck my Favorites don't show up on the new version. 
I better stop messing around with @KirstieAlley &amp; go walk my dogs!   Real life sucks!  I much prefer my TweetDeck!
@heyitsMade : I have no idea, I'm using web now :p TweetDeck won't work? 
Tweetie is playing up  only gives one result for nearby,search, and trends. And then will not load the tweet profile. Should I switch app?
My #ERIC banner is gone on Tweetie. 
@TweetDeck 'Group' is not working. I only get random tweets. I keep having to check specific users in firefox to catch the missed ones. 
Twitterific is all screwed up on my phone 
@chantongcheng i faced the same problem too while trying to install TweetDeck! 
@Tweetdeck the app does not accept special characters on my system... 
TweetDeck v0.25.1b doesn't seem to minimize into an icon in the system tray. Argh 
@CelesteStewart  thanks Celeste! enjoying using TweetDeck so far. Congrats on your sale! it's deathly slow for me at the moment. 
after fighting with tweetdeck for a while I finally got my Tweetdeck window back, no clue what happened 
So I should turn off my TweetDeck and open eclipse and start studying for my java exam....less then two weeks 
@Rinokkuma I use TwitterFon but errors do happen occasionally 
Thinking about suspending TweetDeck. It just managed to use up more memory than all other processes on my machine  Client suggestions?
@ElleSergi updated Tweetdeck? Upgrade FAIL, i'm not keen, it lies and it cheats. 
What's the hell? Trouble with Tweetdeck  
Why, despite putting Tweeple in groups, does Tweetdeck seem to display some people's tweets and not others? I keep missing tweets 
TweetDeck update failed 
Tweetdeck update is all messed up, now it doesnt minimize to system tray, doesnt show popup for new tweets. Its getting over me now 
@TweetDeck Since v0.25.1b deleting my tweets via TweetDeck does delete them from my account, but they remain in TD. 
Twitpocalypse is still not fixed in twitterrific 
Twhirl also seems to cause my laptop to overheat and hang... 
Twitterific is back online! But my neck, shoulder n back is not 
My TweetDeck v0.25.1 upgrade  keeps failing 
@TweetDeck  please, please do something about the h**ies, *** sophies - i think i have blocked about 25 already today 
I didnt open Tweetdeck until 2pm, i am losing my powers! 
After I upgraded TweetDeck to v0.25.1b favorites and &quot;in reply to&quot; are broken 
@TweetDeck   What is the md5sum  or the url of the latest release , having problems  updating on Arch Linux 
Tweetdeck doesn't like unicode. 
Aww. TweetDeck is dead! 
@BlueSuede31 BlueSuede31@thecamerokid ~noooooo! U bet not!  about 1 hour ago from UberTwitter in reply to thecamerokid --i bet not what?
Just got this back. Twitterific's not working. 
@embly917 I stopped using Twitterific aged ago and moved to Twitterfon, but then they added ads too 
twitter is not sending all received tweets to my phone  how do I find TwitterBerry??
Too bad that #Seesmic_Desktop still has no support for #Laconica. That is what keeps me on Twhirl for my day to day micro blogging. 
Friendfeed is down, again. 
Friendfeed is down 
With its latest update, Tweetdeck no longer remembers its window position properly. 
@Coincidence It's not quite as easy as TweetDeck E.g. If they have not made a tweet yet you can't add them 
@richardlai I thought you were using Tweetie now? I got rid of Tweetdeck - not a big fan of Adobe Air 
@leocomerlato I like Twitterrific  I have tweetie, it isnt bad but I do prefer Twitterrific 2.0
@TweetDeck so the @ replies fix - was that only for tweetdeck? i still can't view &quot;in reply to&quot; for other tweet sources. 
@kevinrose Error on that link for Tweetdeck. 
@missmadison Tweetdeck is being stupid for me. 
Realtime Twitter searches and trending topics: Which one is better - Monitter, TwitTabs or TweetDeck? I can't decide. 
@josiefraser Just tried Lifestream plugin for Wordpress (http://tinyurl.com/lk3grj) but it generated an error. 
I was hoping Tweetdeck 0.26 would feature minimize to tray 
Twitterrific is confusing me. 
I loaded TweetDeck today, after @Djalfy was kind enuf to explain but I think its too much for my old computer! Things are crashing! EEK! 
All set to upgrade Tweetdeck but got an error message after the download.  
I've already got TwitterFon but started using Tweetie because of multiple accounts. TweetDeck for iPhone is not available in the UK yet 
I keep getting an error from updating TweetDeck. 
I won't use Seesmic b/c I am loyal to 12seconds and they are on TD, I do however have to use Twhirl to tweet from other accts 
is quickly running out of remaining API calls on TweetDeck! 
@iaindodsworth No sign of TweetDeck at the App Store yet. 
Dear @TweetDeck, 2.6 is great 'n all, but I REALLY miss 'minimize to tray.' It never gave me any problems, why can't *I* have it back!? 
I don't see TweetDeck in the App Store 
@TweetDeck AHHHH iPhone client just crashed on me 
@TweetDeck - searching says it's not there 
Tweetdeck still not coming up for me on the app store on my touch.  http://ff.im/446C8
WTF I want TweetDeck or TwitterFon @banquier and @MissMissaB....and no smartass remark @edoswald, I gotta wait till next year 
Tweetie already lost out on my iPhone, and with now TweetDeck iPhone-Mac sync, Tweetie Mac might just be knocked out too. Sorry @atebits. 
@MuzikChild_Saul LOL. Twitterrific is actting up on me. 
TweetDeck for iPhone is nice, but it won't let me create a TweetDeck account for sync with desktop app 
I wish TweetDeck wouldn't run out of API so quickly. 
TweetDeck iPhone keeps crashing on 3.0  lots of times when I click to view a tweet others when I try and scroll. #tweetdeck #iphone
@safesolvent And you are using Tweetie to send that report... Not cool 
Testing Tweetdeck app on iPhone. Great, but disappointingly no simul support to post updates on Facebook  
got the new Tweetdeck the moment it came out, before the servers crashed. Holla! Except then I couldn't update my PC version  but its  ...
setting up TweetDeck - gotta say, loving the new improvements - sucks that I paid for Tweetie on my iPhone  #tweetdeck
@TweetDeck any chance of restoring the number of new tweets at the top of the column? I miss that feature 
TweetDeck for iPhone lets you register  (for syncing) with less than 7 character password but then desktop won't accept less than 7 
@schneidermike My Tweetdeck groups did not import  what did I do wrong?
Checking out TweetDeck for iPhone. Very cool so far, and free!!! It has groups for people you follow, wohoo!!! No rainbows though 
Tweetdeck just crashed on me. 
@GenkiGenki Hmm my TweetDeck has error when trying to update  Not cool
@dambold @adambrault @junsten awwwww. no landscape keyboard.    ok, so Tweetie has ONE thing better than TD.
And TweetDeck crashed again.  All I wanted was to upload a pic.
OMFG now TweetDeck crashed just after me adding @engadget to a group. 
TweetDeck keeps crashing.  I like it though.
@iainplaysdrums Typing feels a little weird with Tweetdeck....and it won't let me look at someones tweete, more than 20 or so.  
Uh oh. Tweetdeck for iPhone just crashed on me   @atebits, don't be discouraged! I still use Tweetie! The account idea is cool tho. use it
Still not able to update to Facebook from TweetDeck?? Well, from the iPhone app 
I don't like how @TweetDeck handles multiple accounts. It's like information overload. 
@paulabbey But I already payed for Tweetie 
Awesome! Tweetdeck crashed my iphone. It was looking to be a pretty spiffy app too    oh well
Just color coded my itouch apps and icons...aka not falling asleep lol 
Giving TweetDeck for iPhone a whirl. It's v sexy. No sign of 3.0 software update yet though. Bums. 
@collegiate There's TweetDeck for iPhone? I use TweetDeck on my PC and it freezes a lot and sometimes kills my tweets. 
Cestou do skoly zkoumam TweetDeck, ale nikde nevydim Trending Topics 
Tweetie is a lil buggy still on 3.0 
Tweetdeck for iphone! how come iphone gets so many twit apps while the folky phones don't 
@jayesh Tried. Tweetdeck Downloading was 98 per cent complete when there was an error. What crap 
Tweetdeck keeps crashing on 3.0  how is it on 2.?
@kapkap The latest version (0.26) of Tweetdeck now support multiple accounts. BUT it doesn't work for me... can't see my tweets 
No swipe on tweets in Tweetdeck 
Argh! TweetDeck crashed 5 times within 10 mins already. Tweets don't automatically mark as READ when viewed? 
Initial TweetDeck use crashes more often than Twitterific or Twitterfon..also slower to load on startup 
TweetDeck for iPhone hangs... Can't keep up with my speed. 
Just trying out TweetDeck. I think I've finally found my favourite twitter client. Also post anti-histamine hangovers suck 
@zsbcreations can you tell me how I sign in on Tweetdeck, I forgotton and can't retweet now 
@danielionescu Same here, Tweetie in my Mac but thinking of chainging to Tweetdeck, but I don't like the UI of the desktop version 
What I don't like about TweetDeck: I can't three-finger swipe to switch columns and it doesn't seem to have ping.fm integration 
@lisam75 I still prefer TwitterFon. 
@CourtneySit Are you seeing avatars in Tweetdeck? They've been blanked out for me all week 
whilst my change of name has worked seamlessly on twitter itself, I've now found its buggered up all my settings on TweetDeck &amp; Twitpc 
The new TweetDeck iPhone app is pretty sweet. Lots of potential, but seems a bit buggy - mine keeps crashing. 
No fair  I can't add @sfannah to a group on TweetDeck for some reason...just not in the list 
TweetDeck for the iPhone occasionally crashes on me. 
TweetDeck for iPhone gr8 free app, but I think I'll stay with Tweetie that I paid for... Still cannot upgrade Tweetdeck for the laptop 
@styletime I think TweetDeck on iPhone is awesome. I believe columns can be deleted. I do have the occasional crash 
Tweetdeck doesn't seem to be able to view trending topics or who's nearby  I'll stick with Tweetie then I guess 
Need help with TweetDeck! Ever since I upgraded to the latest version, when I minimize TweetDeck, it goes to Taskbar and NOT system tray 
I'm VERY impress with @TweetDeck on the iPhone. A lot of though has gone into it with the column use &amp; design. No update sound though lol 
TweetDeck download failed again  #TweekDeck
Tweetdeck won't work.  
Tweetdeck is being a bit too random about refreshing  shame
@The_Librain oh, and at school I got Twhirl on my computer and now it asks for security check on every second tweet. 
Playing with new TweetDeck AIR app &amp; iPhone App. Love group syncing. Created a GeekDad's group and realized I missed a few... 
@TweetDeck I sure wish you had a Palm app 
Attn #squarespace : if i had a new iphone 3GS i'd be able to play with the new free Tweetdeck app.. instead i wonder with my $50 Nokia 
Tweetdeck update failed! Retrying! 
I still like the app I paid for...Tweetie. Sorry, Tweetdeck. 
@kellypuffs I broke my TweetDeck  had too many incoming tweets then. I could grab an ice cream on the way back - i really fancy that
@TweetDeck the new version is lovely, but some of the dialog boxes are not usable  http://twitpic.com/7m5kv
I wish they would come out with Tweetie for Windows. 
@kenshane My install keeps failing on that Tweetdeck.  
Twitterific is misleading it's neither terrific or much like web twitted 
Stupid URL shortener not working on Tweetdeck 
@MrShlee Also, a landscape keyboard. Why is Tweetie the only app that can do this? 
Really liking TweetDeck on iPhone. Just wish the desktop version wasn't AIR. 
@TweetDeck nice iphone version, but doesn't support dashes (-) in e-mail address' for tweetdeck accounts  (is supported in AIR version)
I can't install Tweetdeck on my laptop because it thinks Adobe Air isn't installed. 
#TweetDeck on iPhone crashes sometimes when u press send after composing a tweet. And u have to compose the whole tweet again  #fail
2 times now, TweetDeck errors out on update download on MacBook. 
TweetDeck on iPhone seems promising, if only it would stop crashing on me...  
just downloaded TweetDeck and don't know how to use it, confusing 
r @Rutilia usaba twhirl, ahora TweetDeck para separar por columnas (e.g. friends, work) y search. TweetDeck no soporta multiple accounts 
Looks like the honeymoon's over. Tweetdeck app is acting buggy as shit today. 
Testing Tweetdeck but it already has crashed twice 
@planetphotoshop If you used TweetDeck, it would be a very lonely place. 
Hmm trying out TweetDeck on my iPhone and i gotta say while it is clean cut and smooth it is lacking the trending topics though 
Tweetdeck for the iPhone seems to be demolishing my API limits 
RC7 Yah what an improvment!! But wont update #TweetDeck 
Downloaded Twinkle 'cause my Twitterific was tweaking... Not loving it so far. Not at all. 
TweetDesk also looks great, and it's free! But I've already purchased Twitterific premium 
@palm_webos_blog no TweetDeck for Pre yet? 
As long as there are so many Iranian tweets to follow, I may need to leave my beloved Tweetie in order to keep things organized in groups 
I am sad @TweetDeck doesn't support @Posterous. 
#Tweetdeck just crashed  back to faithful Tweetie - loving the copy/paste and updated SMS, much better!
Tweetdeck without mobypicture  - http://mobypicture.com/?vyrz4a
Continually getting Error# 16824 when trying to install TweetDeck update 
Oh dear lord.  What have I done.  Just installed TweetDeck on my wee computer, and I can tell that the program is too much for it.  
de regreso a Twitterrific, TweetDeck se cuelga demasiado... 
My Tweetdeck is undergoing some changes, sorry if I haven't been replying to some of you guys.  Also, anybody tweet anything interesting?
something seems to be broken with the 'trends' feature in Tweetie, it only load one tweet at a time??? 
ugh. mom is hogging the computer and i cant get on TweetDeck 
Suffering Tweetdeck withdrawl 
Tweetdeck wouldnt work 4 some reason, and we had 2 get rid of our dog 2day!!!   
I don like the newer version of TweetDeck 
I should be using Twhirl, but I'm too lazy to launch it..... and I feel incredibly crappy now. 
Sorry @TweetDeck  http://twitpic.com/7ooy8
My TweetDeck app keeps crashing... 
@serenacyh What apps are you using you find best? Statuzer having same groups prob that Tweetdeck had now 
Tweetie birds...I'm sleepy yet tired of being in the bed.  having tonsillitis is no fun !
@jpsfancy it was a geek joke that Tweetdeck butchered  basically, no surprise they shuffled off the mortal coil
while the new #Tweetdeck updates are good, I am not able 2 minimize the app to the system tray. It used 2 happen with d earlier version. 
so i guess TwitterFon only allows up to 100 &quot;requests/views&quot; per hour? LAMEEE.  
Tweetie doesn't type in landscape 
There is so much wrong with the TweetDeck UI I can't get used to it 
Tweetdeck for iphone doesn't have facebook link. 
@davidm_en - far as I know you can't change the font-size and only one other font choice #Tweetdeck 
Waarom is de fucking 'in reply to' link weg in Tweetdeck 
Why does TweetDeck no longer minimise down to an inconny thing in Vista.  I have to keep the window open now, it's very unwieldy 
also just noticed that when I minimize new updated version of Tweetdeck, it doesn't go to system tray, it stays in regular toolbar 
Tweetdeck won't update the all friends column, just my mentions! Silly! 
Twitterific isn't working for me 
@FGomes27 Nice! I'm using Seesmic Desktop..the main &quot;rival&quot; against Tweetdeck. By the way, I also got an exam tomorrow 
So... I lied yesterday... I did upgrade my iPhone software. ...and TweetDeck (for iPhone) keeps crashing on me. 
Using tweetdeck right now...must admit it's pretty nice. Awww TwitterFon 
Twitterific isn't working. 
@simonwilder  the amount of work I am getting done is unreal!  Then I installed Tweetdeck 
My Tweetdeck is broken 
Tweetdeck on Iphone is all sorts of awesome still miss my shrink to tray on the PC version though really turns me off using it 
@harrisiirak I know. I used DestroyTwitter for a long time, but I need my Groups. DT isn't TweetDeck yet  #DestroyTwitter #TweetDeck
@Ginger_ASF I have Twitterrific and TwitterFon and can't decide. Now, people are freaking for the TweetDeck app! Too many choices... 
anyone notice any problems adding ppl into groups in the new version of @TweetDeck? i'm getting the &quot;oh dear&quot; message 
@MarkXA I am running Seesmic 0.3 - no luck. 
Why has Tweetdeck got rid of the 'in reply to' function? Or has it just moved? It was a great way to find random threads of convo 
@marketa_klara Thx for hinting at Tweetdeck. But it looks like Tweetdeck misses &quot;Trends&quot; which is a dealbreaker 4 me.. 
Tweetdeck squish squashes your tweets.   http://twitpic.com/7r61q
Wondering why Tweetie did not update my icon. 
@8a22a Wow, the problem has been ongoing since TweetDeck's launch. 
Why can't I add my followers to groups with @TweetDeck? The list doesn't have all of my followers 
Tweetie---you kinda suck!! I paid $3 for you dammit. Could've gotten myself a red bull with that money. Or a ball to play with outside. 
I don't like the new version of TweetDeck. 
TweetDeck is really buggy! I'm having alot of trouble out if it and it keeps crashing! I might have to go back to TweetFon. 
Tweetdeck is losing out to Tweetie... I'm not impressed yet... 
Tweetie isn't working well.. it doesn't tell  me when there are new tweets 
Looks like it'll be a week or two before TweetDeck accumulates all of the people I follow so I can start making groups. 
my TweetDeck (linux) uses over 308MB of ram    ... always slows my machine.
Tweetdeck... Huhuhu... My trusty reliable Tweetdeck is failing me today... 
@TweetDeck you don't minimize to the system tray anymore? 
WTF! Tweetdeck just ate my tweet!  #TweetdeckFail ...i'm experimenting to see what would cause it to eat my tweets so I can avoid this
I don't like when TweetDeck lags. 
if only TweetDeck showed the trending topics. I like to see what's cool so I won't be uncool. 
@zkiraly I have the same problem on the iPhone Tweetdeck, esp. after installing 3.0. Sucks when I lose what I wrote   Back on Tweetie too.
@zkiraly I have the same problem on the iPhone Tweetdeck, esp. after installing 3.0. Sucks when I lose what I wrote   Back on Tweetie too.
Tweetie on my Mac is asking me to sign in &amp; is not recognising my Twitter credentials... 
Tweetdeck on iphone, how does one delete direct messages 
huhuhu i don't like UberTwitter..it's confusing 
@racco I uploaded a .png (http://tr.im/lkstamp). Seems I just have to wait for Tweetie to catch up. 
@saschel /me can not haz iphone.  I was comparing Twitter website, Twhirl, Tweetdeck and then Tweetie.
Em peta molt sovint el TweetDeck 
TweetDeck does not accept my new password  Any ideas?
@Hex29A Bah, TweetDeck kunde inte visa mitt sad face. 
problemi con #TweetDeck 
Ah hello Tweetdeck. I've been neglecting you. 
My TwitterBerry is broke  
Tweetie's search function doesn't seem to be working properly. Only gives me one result when I know there are lots more. 
@PhoenixHawk &amp; @esasse: I have installed TweetDeck but it does not start, process hangs just there (Taskmanager) nothing else 
@thurrott I like Tweetdeck (much better than Thwirl) - no Blackberry client, though.  
In experimenting w/ TweetDeck's search function, I've realized that noone appears to be tweeting about geology or geophysics. 
@fraserke try using Tweetdeck as your twitter client - it has an in-built translation tool...though Iranian isn't listed 
I think that TweetDeck has some bugs. 
Except.... TweetDeck keeps quitting on meeeeee 
@OSUSquire It's frustrating...Tweetdeck for the iPhone crashes all the time and has various bugs, and Tweetie's search is broken 
@twidroid favorites added from Twidroid v2.1.7 are not being recorded in twitter web but showing on phone  any ideas?
TwitterFon always crashes. 
Not happy w/ TweetDeck for iPhone anymore. It crashes a lot and doesn't start me off where I left off like TwitterFon does. 
@MartinOrton I tried Tweetdeck once and didn't really like it - I like the web it's just that the icons are gone 
@MartinOrton Tweetdeck website is not working 
@writereader Tweetdeck giving me all sorts of problems tonight too!  #tweetdeckfail
@mblake118 lol! Tweetdeck is shit btw :/ runs out of api calls or something and deletes peoples tweets 
Trying hard to embrace uber twitter, really I am - but seriously missing Tweetie, it's just not the same  http://myloc.me/4yeS
@Custardcuppcake *pout* your tweets don't show up on Tweetdeck for me again  How are you?
Everytime I start digging the iTouch Tweetdeck app it crashes on me. 
Twhirl is not working...I wanted to use two twitter accounts at once - does not work 
I Can't Get TwitterBerry 
Tweetdeck for my PC rocks but it just keeps crashing for my iPhone  #fail
I wonder why when I updated my Tweetdeck, I can't see any more messages 
@MartinOrton Still got get into TweetDeck website. Am trying Twhirl but really still prefer the web... if only it worked properly 
Yay!! Tweetdeck! Idk why I spend so much time on twitter when my friends don't even come on. 
there`s something wrong w my Tweetdeck 
The new UberTwitter is nice! If you don't use UberTwitter, you suck. Okay..time for work.  
@theebayk1d you haven't even given TweetDeck a chance.  They updated and released a iPhone app and everything!!
Attention Tweetdeck. `Groups' is busted. It would be great, if it worked. At all. It's the least intuitive feature you have. 
Attention Tweetdeck. `Groups' is busted. It would be great, if it worked. At all. It's the least intuitive feature you have. 
My mentions section in TwitterFon is completely dead. I have to catch my mentions in the friends view 
Are there general issues with Twitter Favorites? Tweetdeck giving &quot;service not found&quot; when marking a favorite, Android not marking favs 
@TweetDeck my new tweetdeck is painfuly laggy 
Something is wrong with TwitterFon!  
Location-based searches don't work in #TweetDeck 
@XennyBrown I am already using Twhirl as a temporary solution 
grrr TweetDeck still won't work 
Tweetdeck for iPhone discards my tweet if I exit the app before pressing send.  Tweetie handles this better.
There are times I wish that TweetDeck didn't allow 'enter' to send tweets - one slightly mis-aimed digit can really make a mess 
My picture is not appearing on TweetDeck. 
@TweetDeck - Hello guys. I'm using v0.26.2 and I think it's kinda buggy  When I try to open a link from TD, it always hung up...
Going to try out #TwitterRide on my G1. #Twidroid just seems to be getting more buggy each time I use it 
Oh no! I'm not ready for my 5K tomorrow.   I had to walk for 1/2 of my running intervals today http://bit.ly/2ncUi #RunKeeper #IHateColds
TweetDeck went from fantasmic to a limp app that cant perform 
@hiphophasaheart Opps my bad for the double tweet Twidroid was trippin...per usual. 
Got TweetDeck because my Twitterific stopped working. Sad 
Does anyone use #TweetDeck with #Windows7???  I can't get it to load.  
Going to use TweetGrid rtight now. TweetDeck is just too hungry for RAM! 
I love UberTwitter, just wish the name was cooler.... 
@horrorshock666 That was on MSN, I don't think you can do it for Tweetdeck. 
Tweetdeck has been crashing at least once an hour ever since I updated to 0.26.  @TweetDeck
@psychicpsych Thanks for the reply, got a few in the end but finding Tweetie the best so far - although it wasn't free 
Why wont TweetDeck show a group's tweets older than an hr prior to my opening it? always seem to miss the best tweets when im offline 
just noticed that Tweetdeck no longer links to the original tweet (that was replied to)...WTF??  
Sorting through all the people I follow is tough. And for some reason a few I follow aren't showing up in TweetDeck when I make groups. 
@strawberrysgirl TweetDeck is cool....til the API runs out. 
hmm, I'm out of API on TweetDeck. 
@sbanawan Same error I get. I am told this is a problem attributed to Twitpocalypse, but the developer has not updated Tweetie yet 
Sure hope TwitterFon goes 3.0 compatible soon. I like it too much to dump it 
Twitterific is not working on my iphone 
Not everyone I'm following is coming up in @ autocomplete &amp; yesterday unfollowed user was still appearing in All Friends list. #TweetDeck 
Tweetie is basically useless with a flakey connection 
Back on TwitterFon, can't get on with TweetDeck. 
Just removed Tweetdeck after my Firewall revealed some very suspicious registry accesses. I like Twhirl anyway. I wish I wasn't so tired. 
@prenvo probably. Tweetie was updated a week ago now for twitopocalypse and still apple haven't approved it 
@TweetDeck please can we have an 'open in safari' button in the browser on the iPhone? Can't figure out a way to bookmark tweeted links 
@kaffee love your new design, though I mostly see tweets on Twitterific  (=no design....)
Is it Air or Tweetdeck that is borked? clicking links opens them in Safari instead of Firefox 
@Hawon I 'used to' love TweetDeck, but there were too many glitches, so I deleted 
@vesech I am ok, a bit tired  migrated to Tweetie, pleasant!! How is work?
... I've extended my API requests.. but i don't wanna give that up for TweetDeck! What do i do? 
@Lisa_OMS heh that was fucking tedious to type w/1 finger on twitfon! Tweetdeck for iphone has lots of features but it's fatally unstable 
The only problem with UberTwitter is I can't edit my profile info  It makes me sad!
@TeriBeau  Tweetdeck's installed: I missed a lot of things without  it 
Just downloaded TweetDeck for iPhone. Seems much better than TwitterFon. Hurrah! Also, not had any DMs for 9 weeks according to this! 
Couldn't update my status on UberTwitter ever since I downloaded the new version   Trying out TwitterBerry for a change
What does pin.mismatch mean? It's an error preventing me from logging into Beejive! 
very much disappointed at #Tweetie.  Even FaceBook was able to get it's update approved and released.  Such a drama. 
How come TweetDeck won't minimize to the tray anymore? 
Has something gone wrong with TweetDeck? After a few week's absence - its not working for me.... 
@DesireeScales Sorry for the bad news, but I didn't see your test tweet in my #sbbuzz search results in TweetDeck 
@eburnette join the club.. I change twitter apps for android..every other day..  I ususally go from Twidroid to Twitterride and back again
I think TweetDeck would be better with a systray icon like Twhirl 
@tjansley Yes, and I don't like it. But this new Tweetdeck is too touchy &amp; I've posted to the wrong account multiple times today. 
My DMs aren't refreshing on my iPhone Tweetdeck 
Anyone able to see my picture through Tweetie or a 3rd party app? I'm seeing it on the twitter website, but not in my twitter application 
@trvsbrkr It makes me blue that Tweetdeck &quot;forbids&quot; me to follow you  I even have the @blink182 deck!! I dont get it 
#TweetDeck keeps starting below my taskbar in Vista.  Moving it and closing it again doesn't fix the issue. 
I wish I could install Tweetdeck at work 
@Itxi_Itx Blip is being a bit of a cunt - search taking forever. Tweetie not too happy right now either - 3 min or so lag on replies. 
@mikepfs I like twitterfon. Tweetdeck crashes all the time. 
http://bit.ly/2UtwEP TweetDeck is weired. It takes an old location and posts to the wrong twitter account 
@kristarella TweetDeck cut off the end of my tweet  ... I think =S
My TweetDeck keeps crashing 
@aydinke Tweetdeck is cool, just installed it my self, better than twitterfox which slows the loading time of the browser 
@thisismaxi - LOL. TweetDeck &gt; Twitterfox? Anyway, being able to smash is an awesome feeling. But 'til now, I haven't perfected it. 
hi ladies. Unfortunately my connection is really bad 2nite &amp; TweetDeck not updating   #RSG
@JohnAFlood sorry, I realised that was reply to my earlier question. I think my friend is a windows user too, so no TweetDeck 
I really really wish @TweetDeck provides some themes just like twhirl did. please, I can't stand the dark UI and can't type hexcodes in! 
My Tweetdeck isn't working. 
everyone's TweetDeck works except mine  poo.
Is there a regular download-url for #Tweetdeck? The flash-button does not work for me right now...  @tweetdeck
Tweetdeck is crashing my PC today 
Oh Tweetie, how I miss you 
@redpandajewelry No, Tweetie, coffee quit me.    I wanted to get married and run away together.
I don't like the new UberTwitter 
TweetDeck is sucking a huge amount tonight. 
@NaythenCash I miss my imeem app 
TwitterFon isn't working properly this morning.  was going to download tweetie but all reviews say it has been buggy this past week.
TwitterBerry isn't working for some reason. This makes me sad. 
@blooms5887 Just use Tweetdeck and you can update facebook and twitter at the same time 
Twidroid installed, lets spam twitter with the g1 google mobile 
TweetDeck supports ?????? 
The new FriendFeed UI is actually manageable at 2:30AM  http://ff.im/1Y2z6
@RLFloyd yeah I am usiing nambu after @fulltimecasual mentioned it on @mactalk it's good but tweetie is... Tweetie! 
TweetDeck Icons Annoyng your Desktop? CHANGE   http://tinyurl.com/dca4r7  (From Devianart  http://tinyurl.com/djg77b )
@bruitist I already have Twhirl . and i will for the other one now  thanking you sir
@DuaneJackson tr.im are doing it with Nambu, bit.ly are doing it with Tweetdeck 
@TalAter Ask @TweetDeck if it is in the works 
Taking screenshots for new TweetDeck website...could someone tweet a twitpic link? thanks 
@TweetDeck I don't have a link, but I am saying &quot;Cheese!&quot; 
@TweetDeck we want UTF-8 encoding support! 
Any way to customize column width in Tweetdeck? I need more room. Must have more columns! 
Planting a Garden...so relaxing  I haven't hit the TweetDeck in a week or so...I'ma get back w/all of ya'll tonite.
@YouHerevideo  I recommend Tweetdeck - you can search by areas of interest to you - there is SO MUCH MORE 
@rlangdon I just want to spread the @Tweetie love to anyone I can 
Checking out Ping.fm, Twhirl, and all these social networking devices... 
is creating a TweetDeck column especially  for #coktup tweeps 
@miamibeach I'm always open to ideas.  As for Tweetdeck I've never tried. For multiple account monitoring I use Tweetgrid and Tweetie.
I'm checking out TweetDeck!  Tried Twhirl, but already see the power, customization, and functionality here... 
Checking out TweetDeck....so far I like it. 
@iliPahgz Ya talkin' about the CrackBerry part, or the Tweetie part? LOL 
@iliPahgz I've seen that before... It's already built in to Tweetie??? Wow, I've learned 2 things tonight! 
@leisajw yup yup... Tweetdeck is pretty cool and u can update facebook too  hope ure well ;) xoxo BJ
@barbtheaussie Hey  using TweetDeck ... interesting 
checking out Twitterrific. Liking it so far. 
Tweetdeck is so cool 
@Adesto i can update twitter AND facebook from TweetDeck, ah another app that encourages lazyness 
So... anyone got the beta of Tweetie they can get me in on? 
@TweetDeck can't download tweetdeck from site.. it says downloading but its not.. help plz 
@TweetDeck cool i'll work on it.. thx 4 ur help 
@DforDog have a look at http://bit.ly/LrmNc, covers pretty much everything  Or use Tweetdeck or Twhirl, which have a better UI
Heya tweeps! Using twhirl for my computer is using a lot of programs right now, might not be able to carry TweetDeck. 
@ZaneMcFate G1 time buddy!  Then u can use Twidroid instead of doin the whole txt thing 
I just downloaded Tweetie and loving it  Thanks all for your recommendations!
playing with TweetDeck  // Geez... whatta dreams... *inlove*
Tweetie today!  @atebits
congratulations from russia TweetDeck 
@drewb Tell me why I should leave Tweetdeck for Seismic? 
Tweetie will be released in few hours 
Anxiously awaiting the release of Tweetie 
OK that was pretty obvious once I clicked the button @Tweetdeck so forget I asked 
Tweetie for mac now available 
@atebits Tweetie is gorgeous 
i tried Tweetie. couldn't find the equivalent to EventBox's profile peeks in like 10 seconds. uninstalled and I'm back on @eventbox. 
With a Tweetie here (iPhone) and Tweetie there (Laptop) I can go and Tweetie everywhere 
Tweetie Testtweet #testing #tweetie 
I looove the iphone version of Tweetie too 
actually I'm counting the minutes until someone cracks the paid-version of Tweetie. 
http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/ Testing just moment ago released Tweetie client 
Check Tweetie http://bit.ly/6FXY New Twitter Client for Mac... very nice 
Tweetie needs to get rid of that dock icon 
@crazylabel ok up and running  one of the criticism for Tweetie seems to be not showing you the number of new msgs since last logged in.
@tweetie @atebits  Tweetie for mac is brilliant  ?
@seismic007 Tweetie has more features just some UI weirdness. And, FYI, I am one of the cool kids boyfriend 
@markboulton After trying Tweetie I've ended up with a Twitterriffic - TweetDeck combo  Still an opportunity for a top class Twitter app
@pk2004  I think @TweetDeck is better being just as simple as it is; making it flashy will detract from it's purpose 
@bigmadkev I really like @TweetDeck but it's the first one i've used so I need to try some others out too 
Trying out Tweetie for mac 
Tweetie's looking pretty good, and working well too! I think i'll make it my main client 
@nihonmonamour TweetDeck rules! 
@MindPowerCoach I have been using and LOVING TweetDeck. Seesmic Desktop is very similar in function, multiple profiles. Using it now! 
@TweetDeck Also automatic URL shortening (in the tweet box, w/o using the URL box) would be a nice feature 
@ariherzog Or you could use Tweetie and see them as a conversation 
@zholmquist And those two good ones appear to be Nambu and Tweetie, at this point 
checando el TweetDeck muy bueno 
Just installed TweetDeck and it's pretty cool! I liked it so far! 
Tweetdeck rocks my boat 
@OtherMacGuffin Tried Tweetie on the iPod touch and have switched to TwitterFon as suggested by a follower! 
@overusedpencil I like Tweetie better because of its conversation feature, like, if you click a tweet, it shows you the replies to it. 
@film_girl Backatme, plz. And, to put you in the mood to do so, this one!  Found u via TUAW Tweetie, BTW. ? http://blip.fm/~4onhf
Liking Tweetie, It just needs integration with Growl and will be great 
Testing Tweetie for the mac...seems acceptable 
Someone tell me how to cancel a search on Tweetdeck, I can't figure it out, thanks in advance 
I am on the computer :O Hahahaha, TweetDeck is working again 
How to install Adobe Air &amp; Tweetdeck on Ubuntu 9.04 64 bit  http://bit.ly/wzTtB it works am using it now 
@jackStowe LOL - thanks  Actually it went on to crash quite a bit but a definite contender for Tweetie replacement (#TwitterBox).
I'm liking UberTwitter, very cool  http://mypict.me/pZG
TweetDeck and Mobile Tweeter. 
Installed Tweetie (http://tinyurl.com/c4afam) on both desktop and laptop - nice piece of software with polished UI, will keep it 
@darylcognito - I use the site, my Blackberry, Brightkit and Tweetdeck - depends on the mood   We're good, how about you and Kuma?
Hey guys TweetDeck is a fun app 2 use!  http://www.tweetdeck.com
Feeling Twitterrific! 
@lieveolaerts Will let you know how it goes, still a very new application. TweetDeck is great so would recommend using that for know 
@ragnarok1971 I'm loving how Seesmic Desktop uses less memory than TweetDeck 
wow! now using Seesmic Desktop with Facebook integration! Well done Loic, Seesmic rocks! 
I just downloaded Tweetdeck.  I  hope it will be a smoother ride than the last plug in I used.  I am being brave. 
@TweetDeck It even matches the colour scheme of my laptop  
Tweetie v helpfully shrinks longer tweet. Brilliant. 
Probando TweetDeck 
finally shifted from Twhirl to TweetDeck so I can filter through my close friends' updates  happy monday peeps
Wow... my god the whole UI is sooo much snappier. It's more responsive than TweetDeck now!  Tweets feel like IMs lol
@destroytoday - Tweetie is using Yfrog now, I think, so any chance of adding it to the in-client image viewing? 
@TheFifthSister LOL yeah  I forgot about your TweetDeck statuses! So funny 
@niw Thought you should mention that you don't need to enable Growl in Tweetie to make your plugin work, and to avoid duped notifications 
@dpfdpf probably something to do with FriendFeed 
Ordering pizzas, watching Diggnation, trying out Tweetdeck. All is good 
Just signed up for Instapaper, great for offline reading 
@JennyRhian Tweetie is a must, Flight Control is addictive and AudioBoo is getting more and more popular, hope that helps 
@lorimcneeartist Didn't anyone ever tell you, don't believe everything you see (or read)!!  Aside from naughty TweetDeck, how are you?
okay really going to sleep now (to act as dividers. Tweetie doesn't allow me to put the contest entry) 
Lovin' the new Twitterrific  great job guys!
@Christopherdfox TweetDeck is where it's at, though. 
@Northorn I haven't used it yet, but I think Tweetdeck has a translation feature built in. 
@RichardCoffre  @PierreTran ni dans TweetDeck d'ailleurs 
is using TwitterFon 
When will Seesmic Desktop implement Friendfeed back into the app? and/or seesmic video? will it be the one that does it all? 
@Grooveecar Just unfollowed you by mistake! Oooops! Note to self: must update old TweetDeck on laptop! 
facem un review pentru TweetDeck 
@loic Wow, didn't know Seesmic is that big 
@stedavies (hmm seems like my TweetDeck is down) Hello Lithuania team, hope the presentation is going well! 
@RubenOlsen I still have to make the optimum use of it....still figuring it out. Evernote is a cool tool though 
Using Twhirl's saved search term feature to pull in #cfobjective tweets regardless of whether or not I follow the folks....I see it all! 
@Amalari I am very well, thanks! How are you? is this a TweetDeck thing? What's the name of the group I'm honoured to be in?! 
TweetDeck is fine 
@Lady_Twitster oh ok good  i hear that all the time and i never have trouble with my TweetDeck.. hey whats your avatar? lol
#followsunday  @nbradbury is the guy who made HomeSite, TopStyle and FeedDemon
Ah, Tweetdeck working again. 
TweetDeck! have ur twitter and facebook in one instance   get it here http://is.gd/MeZ #twitter #wolfram|alpha #3hotwords #delongeday
@agiam You're doing great! When you get more followers, you might want to download Tweetdeck. Manages things so much better than web! 
@SRIshanu Windows 7 ! pin TweetDeck to the taskbar! 
I'm lovin my UberTwitter vs Twitterberry. Thanks to my sexy beast @ailinalei but I'm keepn TwitterBerry as a backup jus in case 
Adeus TweetDeck, adeus DestroyTwitter, bem-vindo twhirl. 
@horrorshowtunez Tweetdeck is better. 
TwitterFon is broken so joint the tweetie clan 
sorry about last @message it was for Jessicas trust but Tweetdeck scrolled as I clicked 
@DHughesy TweetDeck uses a heeeeeeeeap of memory apparently, it may chew your computer up. Twhirl is a sweet alternative 
@DHughesy the only way Tweetdeck will ruin your life is you'll not find anything more awesome and you might not be able to live with that 
@TJxWaffles You should have a gander at it, I tried TweetDeck but Twhirl is prettier 
Trying out TweetDeck for Ubuntu... Makes more sense if you have a lot of followers. Yet again my unpopularity conspires against me 
oooh.. just downloaded Tweetic for mac to try. NICE! i prefer this instantly as compared to TweetDeck! 
What I love about TwitterFon   http://twitpic.com/5f6ar
@Rockermama4 I had twitterberry, then switched to UberTwitter, which is a LOT more user friendly  [re: twitter for bberry]
is enjoying her new TweetDeck  application. 
@DonnaSpeaks Just opened Tweetdeck &amp; saw your tweet...got alot to do and this just grounded me. TY  G'Mornin' Friend!
@michaelowens still lost  I don't see 'bookmarks' on my contact list.  But, if it's truly &quot;meh&quot;, I'll probably just stick to Tweetie.
@becausei http://twitpic.com/5oi1t - Loving TweetDeck in the background there 
@Funzafunza easy fix: Buy the much better Tweetie app 
Tweetie for mac love! 
Exploring TweetDeck 
@Kaypearl I'm one of the 6 people using Gtalk, so I should have no problems 
@JaySkillz Twhirl is like TweetDeck.. but I find it to be much much much much better. You can search and DL for free 
@PitBullChat Tweetdeck is the greatest thing since sliced bread. 
@Carly_FTS I will resist TweetDeck a little bit longer... 
@Milonare hi hun. tried to get Snaptu but my fake nokia 6030 refused. Fothogari kabisa. azawise, iz how the sunshine? 
just downloaded TweetDeck so far so good 
@SaraVegas Tweetie?! are u awake right now?!

Checking out the blink 182 TweetDeck
