@basscomm ack, it is too hot for no AC 
Came home to find that the AC isn't working...not cool...literally! 
AC off = extraordinarily hot. AC on = super de duper cold. I can't win 
planned on swimming today but girls have sore throats today.   thankful for AC inside! making list of stuff i need to do
@NorthernDennis i have AC in my bedroom...but does not seem to be making out to the living room 
@Spoked wtb AC  my little fan doesnt help, this heat is killing me.
I can't get the AC temp set perfectly it is either too hot or too cold. 
@shanesss I wish I had that issue   They're testing fire stuff here at work, so our AC is off. Blerg.
Man it's a weather advisory day. Elderly and young child stay inside today.. Under a fan or AC, my lungs r killing me.  I hate asthma!
Hoping the notes about giving us AC aren't a cruel joke by the maintenance people.  My best fan broke last night.  
Holy crap is it hot in my car without AC  black interior ftl durring summer
Holy crap, is it hot in my car without AC  Black interior FTL during summer.

Trying to keep my  cool at work- the AC is broken!

Going under the knife   Cleaning out of the AC joint is the name of the game - now to find a hole in the schedule

Lots of sun today, office AC still out of order 
@Reflexao Ooommmggg...! The AC movie has Apollo in it, my favorite AC character! Kevin stole him from my town in the DS game 
I broke down &amp; turned on the AC.  I am going to cry when the electric bill comes. Shouldn't have spent so much $ when I was in Alaska. 
I do believe my fursuit isn't going to be ready in time for AC, this is fine as I'm not going to AC but still 
The AC in my room is busted 
@podnosh warm? We're f'ing melting here! got about 15 PCs, 20 screens, 2 big LCDs, and 2 printers in a room with no AC  28c so far
@roguekitty unfortunately, because of previous statistic, it's not worth buying AC, so too hot is TOO hot. 
So I'm still sick and of course I did too much yesterday and it got worse. So I'm trying to get some sleep and what happens? The AC dies. 
Sweating!  The AC isn't working on my side of the house! 
ahh it's still sooo hot in here   hopefully they have the AC fixed at work today
there are things I want to do...but it is to dang hot to even think of doing them   even inside in the AC...haha, guess thats an excuse!
Why does it have to be so hot out? My car doesn't have AC 
@EDouglasWW sometimes if it's really hot, i leave the AC on for my cat. 
library...working out....and pretty sure the AC in my car is about to go....noooooo 
Laptop is fixed  New Battery &amp; AC Adaptor = Sorted.
30million bells on AC:WW

@jellerton it was a very pensive examination of a current circumstance. your not supposed to know. glad to hear AC was great.

@mklujszo maybe used to have. Besides without AC it's too hot to sleep 
@jackgraycnn catching up on my tweets, I saw AC's promo of your new blog before yours, I knew immediately it would be yours by the title 
mini Mommy's day roadtrip to AC 
Oh and good news! My mom got her car worked on before our NIN|JA trips later this month and the AC is now working! 
http://twitpic.com/4yhgg - me and Kate in AC... we were with the band, seriously. 
thesis complete  one more paper to write. AC in a week. not bad, not bad at all!
@kushanmitra AC does not need the moniker to make us look bad, he manages it even without the interesting name 
Sometimes you're lucky, the AC adaptor from an old router I don't use fits the #QY70 
@adamjackson I'm loving my AC. 
@Coriantura Heh. I think AC Clarke might've labeled dark energy as &quot;magic&quot;. Only reason for believing it exists is our eqns don't work. 
@boochicko Thanks!  I'll post pictures up soon!  And yep, we DID go all out! The only thing that would've made it better is outdoor AC. =X
@JustF0rFun well...asteptam sa vedem daca se mentine durerea - am oprit AC-ul in zona mea 
AC test then billy mays speech 
@annabranch Sounds to me like he is saying the AC is running a bit too much at night. 
Goodmorning everyone! It is going to be 100 degrees outside today! whew, good thing I work inside with the AC 
@mrlosik of course not! Crazy unregulated heat in winter, no AC in summer - gotta love hundreds-year-old buildings 
@ACALLPRO  Thanks AC!!!!! 
The Tip of Borneo was breathtaking n surreal. After 4 hours of bumpy bus ride, it didn't disappoint  - AC
