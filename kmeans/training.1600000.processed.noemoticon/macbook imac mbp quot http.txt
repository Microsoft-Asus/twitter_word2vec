@luxuryluke I was thinking I didn't have burn-in on my iMac, but now I see that I do. 
The MBP 13&quot; looks good.  But it's not mine 
expecting my MBP back this morning, AppleCare had it less than 24 hrs, I'm not real confident that it is fixed this time either 
MBP arrived yesterday but haven't had the time to play with it 
guess I won't be able to play with my MBP over the weekend   ...didn't ship till this morning
Ready to buy a 22inch samsung display 4 the MacBook 4work. But the iStore NEVER has the cable u need to make the magic happen 
@wisequeen time to get that new MacBook pro! Sorry to hear about your pc 
mystery solved: #MBP display blackness is due to screwed up graphics card, chip dead... a week to repair though  bad news for the show 
@czarthp Well imy friend has a MacBook as well n her Safari looks fun/great/updated. Tho mines nstalled, I don't c a change  ima ask her
after 5 long healthy years, my sweet iMac had the ultimate meltdown last night, and is now sadly, in a coma. i'm numb 
No luck trying to unlock an AMD Phenom X2 550 CPU... after activating the ACC the system doesn't boot, so the other 2 cores are defective 
Resurrection of the G3 PowerBook!!! Why is all the cool new stuff only supported on Intel? 
@robbyrussell That's because their old crappy netscape server died I think. I can't track my MBP either. 
Getting mac fixed. Keyboard and mouse wont work 
@plainchicken Congrats! When did you order you MacBook Air? I'm still waiting on mine 
has to make a complaint MacBook's keyboard 
Came back from lunch and my EeePC won't boot. 
My laptop just blue screen crashed. I got nervous, then excited, then nervous again. Seems to be working again. No new MBP today 
booked my poorly MacBookPro in for repair. 
BTW:  This is Day 2 &amp; still no call from #Dell regarding my #Inspiron5100...I'm quite disappointed. I've been a faithful customer but... 
@tdhurst I know someone who had his MBP stolen recently and hasnt had it replaced yet...hmmm 
just put together some specs for a fileserver and possible HTPC...getting really excited but the calculated price is a buzzkill 
@ram8727 yup a trade cause alot of cases ex. Incase slider I can't get in my country cause there is no apple store 
@fys Sorry, I haven't seen any (why I got the white MacBook, which has a firewire port) 
Genius bar appt not until Staruday.  I hope I can survive without my iMac. Wonder how long it would take them to replace the hard-drive.
Just changed over from windows to a n iMac n none of my old software works oops picked the wrong time to do my web maintenance n trouble 
@jkOnTheRun yes using sonyericsson ds970 it's possible only to press play/pause, using htc bt Stereo S100 it's even worse: only volume 
Woohoo! Voyager Q, new eSATA card and RAM arrived from @macsales.  Sadly, the MBP order is not even processed at Apple yet.  
I want my MacBook back  Good thing I have AppleCare, though. Would've cost me a kidney to have it fixed otherwise.
@softlysoftly ..but I'm having SuperDrive issues  it was semi borked before I opened it up but lol!
MacBook away for repairs 
It's amazing how fast my netbook now running ubuntu (for netbook) boots up. I can't say the same for when it ran win7 
Enfusing bracketed shots...  iMac CPU cores at 100%. it's going to be a very hot day at the office 
@JessieKozak I got an iFrogz hard cover though I paid more  lol... http://bit.ly/2JSuZ
I might have to resign to the fact I have to get a glossy screened netbook. Why can't manufacturers stick with matte? 
AppleCare says water damage on my MacBook -- wtf? Never spilled anything on it, but time for renter's insurance 
Wants a MacBook REEEAL bad 
OK, two things on new iPhone 3GS, 1) iSkin doesn't fit  and 2) why does my wikipedia app always require a full new download after restore
I HATE it when my MBP doesn't go to sleep before I put it in my bag and an hour later I find it trying to burn a hole through the bag. 
My computer is now in life support after 9 years of service. It could die anytime, any minute now..  I'm hope I could get a Macbook soon..
@jeffstearns Don't think these will work in your iMac 
I cannot, for the life of me, figure out how to install Windows 2000 onto my iBook G3 
For everyone who's asked: I cut it on the internal steel part of my HTPC case.  Cut the tip right off 
I installed the new RAM in my MacBook and now it has shutdownn issues  figures...

Ugh! Backlight on MacBook busted. Whole LCD needs to be replaced. 
wishing J's mouse would work, I dislike using the trackpad.  Also wishes he'd wake up.. tis lonely without him.
Thought I found the ideal #HTPC with the Acer Aspire #Revo, but why oh why did they not include digital audio out.. no deal I'm afraid 
Heading to the Apple store today...having several issues with my MBP and its only been a week 
Just picked up a Firewire 400 to 800 cable from Monoprice, since iMac doesn't even have a 400FW port anymore 
Deskjet printer won't feed heavy photo paper correctly. Not happy and wasting paper

I dared to update my software, and now I'm now stuck using the behemoth iMac as my laptop refuses to work again. This is annoying.
