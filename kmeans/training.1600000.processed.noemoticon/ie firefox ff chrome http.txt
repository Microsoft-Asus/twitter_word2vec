@Sunyshore If you use Firefox why not just make a bookmark to it in your toolbar and reteach yourself to click that? 
@bobmorse the same question in another light: why do we still care to develop sites to be IE6 compatible. Both things make me sad 
being reminded I'm supposed to design sites for IE. I'm on FF sometimes safari. IE!? haven't used it in a decade but I gotta design 4 it.

I noticed most victims so far are women. And they feature Firefox. And they got off the main plot again

@justafish Interesting article, but a tad unrealistic. Much as I would like to see the back of it, IE6 is still 15% of our audience 
@addyosmani Looks pretty nice, but I get about 2fps in Firefox 3.5 and it's not working at all in Safari 4 
After 3 days of Safari 4 it seems as it finally grew up, and Firefox got fat and old 
@vishal_modh yup you're right! ..and also every dog has a day. We know IE had their days. Still in France most of people use IE6

I hate IE!  so many annoying problems!
@wakachamo lol it's not like other browsers haven't taken cheap shots at IE. 
 I know @twitter's not going to bother coding much for IE6, but having to pull up indiv tweets every time I reply is getting old. Fast.
@cabel the best part about that is when you do use an IE8 useragent it says to disable compatibility mode in the hints 
@trapwire Firefox.  Instead of opening the java application it just opens a million Firefox windows.  Sad.

@dupree_ IE8 is good! Used it, like it! Just cant get out of Firefox tho 
Hmm... trying Windows Update, seems to have an update to IE8 for Vista x64 in there.  Too bad I can't use Firebug in this case 
@kevinlogan Probably NEVER ;) A few features I looked at will work on IE8 and not Firefox. Others vice versa. 
wtf is up with my laptop? Firefox is struggling and when I play music it keeps cutting out. 
Again guys sorry for any mispellings/typos or bad links today I c&amp;p most everything and still can't delete with IE to correct 
My day just isn't complete until Firefox crashes...
