Mir every single morning I feel sick 
My xbox as finally given up the fight 
@Sheamus and the dont do 3D 
Enjoyed Wrestlemania and would much rather be at home then being stuck at work 
in super taco. I have to walk to school.  and im testing today! DX
@iamcheerbear don't hurt or hate me! I mayyyyy have lost my ring 
@Sheamus any chance you can switch from bit.ly to tiny url? I can't read any of your links at work as bit.ly gets stopped as 'malicious'. 
@HDNet Please put the ROH shows on your Xbox 360 channel.  I don't get your channel so I don't get to see ROH.  
Working on WWF banners now. Was very upset when I figured out that WWF was some panda stuff and not World Wrestling Federation  
No Arianny Celeste at UFC 97, I'm bumbed  But I have the UFC Undisputed demo! WOOHOO! #ufc
UFC 97 is gonna to be spectacular! Wish I could be in Montreal right now... ugh, stupid exams...           WAR Silva!! WAR Shogun!!
@Tazz602 mehhh, open-source tools and apps rarely do, in my experience. 
Poor Chuck Liddell   I thought Rua would gas if it went beyond the first... That, however, did not occur.
So not happy about the fight. 
dammit, didn't get to hang with Roxx last night, but doing so tonight. she leaves tomorrow. 
Petey misses Sali 
is it over yet??? i dozed off..   #UFC
The Silva fight was not what I expected. Over all UFC 97 a let down 
@RoyalAntsJosh btw, fights were pretty disappointing. 
@BylliCrayone about to fall out. Just watched UFC. Poor Chuck Liddell 
just got back from a rather disappointing UFC main event 
#ufc97 had some good fights. Rua is back. Liddell is gone  Silva needs to quit dancing around and end fights.
Liddell lost tonight  .. upset but not surprised, he is getting too old to fight.
@DynamicImage &amp; every1 else Sorry i couldn't reply. Battery ran out.  But yeah I was happy Shogun won but Silva could of finished Leites!
Chuck Liddell is so out of shape it's not even funny.  the biggest belly fat I've seen in the Octagon.
I got in a fight with him... 
bummed that I missed the UFC fight last night 
At work.   But at least Shogun won  
5 weeks till the next UFC.

@jamesbeston My mother considered the Rumble Tums breakfast bowl a frippery , so I never got one  I used to recite the poem to punish her.

WEC 41 Brown V Faber and Pulve got sub'd in the 1st in like 30 seconds 
@fozzyfan not gonna be happy with the new ECW champion 
hmmm... just realized this is the first live MMA show I've seen since Tapout Mask's death. 
Wishing i could be watching Extreme Rules live on PPV but i can&quot;t  have to go online to keep up
@Eminemdrdre00 &amp; Batista is meant to be hurt. :s They made Orton look crap... I'm so confused. Andddd, no Ted. 
Reading the PPV results. Not a happy camper. 
@jenniejennie I'm glad we're not watching the PPV tonight. I'm beyond pissed off. 
crap, forgot about WEC 
i can't watch the WEC.. i'll have to settle for the online replay later on.. 
I want a really good beer right now. PBR isn't going to cut it. 
@capitaln Actually, oops. I did NOT realize you were in my ring. 
ummm... Never mind... PUNK cashed in MitB 
@mandystafford Did Urijah win?  I don't have Versus    But I'm rooting for him!
@KD4RKOnever did like Punk  would have liked to see Orton keep the title, the rest was pretty good though
@maggiehendricks Concur.  Great fights, one after another.  I called most of them correct... just not Jens   next time.  #MMA #WEC
So upset that Mayweather vs. Marquez fight postponed! I'm already excited to watch it next month. 
Dang. Mayweather v Marquez will have to wait for another while. Money May hurt his ribs. 
Mayweather-Marquez postponed due to Money-May rib injury 
As much as I tried to fight it (ignore it) I have a cold 
#gameporn I just tried thinking up something Okami-based, but then I had this horrible mental image involving painting lube and yiff.

@EveMarieTorres Aaw does that mean you're not going to be on RAW tonight? 
wishing i was watching RAW instead of doing patient reports 
I feel really bad bout her . 
@Demonsnake666 Wrestling is horrible! 
@lalunetropbleme ECW's at least better than Raw.  But yeah, WWE for you. Two of the best female wrestlers in the world is on the C-show.
@Mania_59 cuz you have &quot;responsibilty&quot; and you can't entirely clear your conscience with sleep and the innocence of childhood anymore 
Aw man...Punk! he's hurt 
@aibiwashere oh gawd! I remember when I used to love the WWF 
rocky 4 makes me wish boxing was really that entertaining in real life. I still want to see a Pacman-Mayweather fight though 
political post, sorry    WTF is up with Obama admin reneging on the gay community? &quot;well, maybe in term 2...&quot; FU, no reelection for u!
