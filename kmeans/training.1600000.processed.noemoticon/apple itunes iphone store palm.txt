Just wrote and ran a little console-base Ruby app on my iPod! I would like to try to add a UI using Rhodes, but I need a mac to compile 
Apple, you're great but sometimes you drive me insane. 
It looks like almost all of you have iPhones. That's settled. Most of you don't have pity for poor, poor Palm 
I want a Palm Pre. 
All the fun stuff is &quot;Not available in the Indian Itunes Store.&quot; You suck, Apple. (and you too Sims3, Kindle, et. al.) 
@epicpetwars looks like iTunes store is having that annoying 8001 error, can't download it at the moment 
@WordofSouth Add some Crown to that Apple Juice or Cranberry and you might have something. Without, its just juice 
I like books, as it's made of paper and ink, but space problems in my room make me crave for Amazon Kindle.

New iTunes update and it doesn't have OS 3.0. 
Oh man!  Wi-fi Modem is on the fritz again.Which means no Internet for a week or two. Thank You Steve for the iPhone
@Simriel I dunno, I've only got a dead Shuffle 
@FrankRamblings and I CAN listen to them on Itunes, so it's not a corrupted file problem

@pfspleen Apple, couldn't get pear from my little shop. 
On the way to southern Iowa - my iPhone doesn't work there  Good thing I actually like the place!

The Palm Pre came out today, wish I was getting one  !
@Seanyybear is it any good on the iTouch? cant believe i lost mine  getting a new one though :/ lmao!
I want a Palm Pre 
My Zune is on the fritz.  Luckily, I still have my Ipod Shuffle. So I can have music while creating my darkroom! Insert evil laugh here.
I have a strong need to listen to the Link Wray station on Pandora. No headphones on me for iPhone, on Amtrak 
My taste in music is so weird that the Genius feature in iTunes hardly ever works. 
@LordGU Couldn't find either of these on French iTunes. 
really likes the look of the Palm Pre, I don't use my phone enough to warrant looking at a phone that'd require a contract though 
I want the new Palm Pre!! But it's sold out valleywide 
@hhernandez1230 I wish this could be done, but sadly Apple won't allow us! 
Just tried out the Palm Pre and I actually don't mind the keyboard after the intial 30 second awkwardness. I miss tactile buttons 
@rom That's another thing  (on getting a Palm Pre)
unfortunately you can not delete the Nascar application from the Palm Pre yet 
Apple &amp; cinnamon tea - how can something that smells so good taste so bad?

@MichaelJurewitz Uff... Away from my usual syncing iTunes... Laptop iTunes wants to wipe my apps to put on WWDC attendee app!  Workaround?

@curwiler yeah, and now my TiVo didn't even record the other station, even though I spend 20 minutes last night setting it up. Argh! 
On the TechForCharity site it says I'm an Apple fanboy. I am not!  (please change...)
Apple sauce for dinner. Its the only thing that will stay down 
@EA_APOC RA iPhone makes me consider getting the iPod Touch over Zune HD. Why did you have to go and complicate the decision 
Have a visit to Apple Store's Genius Bar in Regent St 2mrw nite as the USB ports on my MacBook stopped,so not able to connect iPhone 
The screen on my 2 years old macbook pro is dead  Then I just found out that its an Apple problem. So they will fix it 
@prof_ebral wish I could! My iphone won't play flash in safari  Apple r u listening?
@saidinjest  I can use blip.tv, but i don't know how to get the link that they have their for iTunes on my site. 
I'm always jealous of the lucky special few who get to go to Apple Keynotes as well as all the other successful people in the world 
Went to the Apple Store, but didn't buy anything. Not even The Sims 3. I'm just not impulsive enough anymore. 
shuffle on iTunes sucks....its not shuffling properly 
Still not over not getting my Palm Pre  but I am tryna avoid the anger &amp; irritation
Tonight I will read a dead tree book (The Somme) because there is no Kindle equivalent.  
@peterfacinelli I can't get your app because I don't have an iPhone or an iPod Touch. Sad story. 
iPod + rain = no more Wi Fi. Going to the Apple store in the AM for some help I hope 
@long73 @jjackson How are yall liking the Pre, heard there were issues with Gmail and Pre?    If Gmail sucks what about live.com?

I guess I'm never watching Netflix &quot;Instant&quot; again. You can't buffer the whole movie, and you can't leave it playing and replay it. Suck. 
Loosed daily statistic for the first day of the previous week from iTunes Connect one more time 
Either Apple or UPS are incapable of handling tracking data. Can't track my MacBook with my reference number

@macboiz Incessantly refreshing the Apple shipping status page to see where my new laptop is  And, weather is good so all is fine.

i broke my Kindle  ....dropped it on the floor
My podcasts in iTunes can never be empty 
Hmmm... Last night I connected my Zune to my Ubuntu box to charge. Today all my ZunePass content is disabled. 
Trying out Rhapsody: I love all-you-can-eat.  But, no mac client, annoying ads (even when I pay), and no way to get music to my iPhone.  
@brianlash ya I just had to give you problems.  Memory = couch change. I want an Apple again. 
@tsevis able to replace it now that Apple stopped producing them.. 
With Macs, Apple provide a good means to migrate from old to new. I've yet to see similar mentioned for iPhones. Anyone? Manually then 
Apple is going over 50k apps. Is that the reason for the delay with update approvals?? that would be such an abuse of power 
My MacBook is on its way back to Apple for repair, third time in less than a month, my love affair with Macs is quickly dying  
Found a crack in the plastic of my iPhone...near the dock port   I wonder if Apple will fix it... * nudges @swirlysnail *
jazz fest with Garret and then going to the Apple Store to get my computer tuned up before my apple care expires tomorrow 
Uhg having trouble deciding. I want a Kindle but I want a new camera. I could buy either right now.. If only I had another $400 
@AlexJReid It downloaded fine, but the file is stored on the server and the dodgy wifi means iTunes can't read it without stuttering 
Oh and my laptops keyboard will never work again, Apple store said water got to some important hardware  but it still works
Just had near miss with iTouch....and Radox 
@chuckscoggins Unfortunately a G4 won't run Apple's newer software, which limits the use for me 
I just might have to make an appearance at the Apple store on Knox Street because they don't answer their phones. What's up with that? 
@mgrimes Am I too fat to be an Apple geek? 
Yikes, we will get tons of iPhone app updates starting tomorrow when the 3.0 firmware is released by Apple. Download galore. 
wait for a call from Apple my Ipod are broken 
Just got my Air back from Apple. HD wiped. Everything gone 
Installing Safari 4 and the iTunes that accepts IPhone 3.0! I hate how it makes you feel &quot;right at home&quot; with the windows look 
sigh! no evernote app for android yet 
@liz Aww dang, now I wish I pre-ordered with Apple instead of AT&amp;T 
Son of a Bitch!!! One game I HAD on my iPhone I bought on sale for .99 now it's 4.99!! I am so pissed! I don't wanna pay that much.... 
home from @sprint without any @Palm_Pre phones. 1 came activated on the wrong acct &amp; the other 1 was just on crack &amp; wouldn't go online 
@bunnynikisha I really want something like a Kindle...but Kindle could only be sold and use in the US. 
Why does the combination of ZoomText and iTunes make my computer slow to a crawl? Didn't used to... 
I want an iTouch! 
I saw &quot;up&quot; it was awesome! So mad cuz I don't got enough money on iTunes to by @Jonasbrothers new album Tomoro. 
Apple Cinnamon cheerios have shredded my mouth. 
@Xm4n  I'd watch him with you if I'd paid DirecTV lmao  uhm, boring. Read more Twilight &amp; downloaded movies to my iPod, laaame!!
@brrmccoy @jsjamie Kindle is a digital book reader. The new one went up in price!  Been looking at Sony instead.
Safari 4 is becoming unusable with its constant crashing. Amazingly, it even dies when I try to view the store page on Apple's website. 
dang it, work kept me late, missed @iamknaan at the Apple store 
@GeminiDragon  my iTunes won't download them
My iTunes softwear says it  won't update till 6-23.   Thank god for the check for update button.  To bad I don't have the iPhone 3.0 early
Another annoying reason to dig the Palm Pre - complete ITunes compatability.  Man I should get paid for this 
@takemyyheart24 wooo!  i don't have any money on iTunes  but i'd buy it if I could.
@uncyherb just read the Gizmodo article. I see how they could do it now. So that sucks. I'd be happy just to use the 700mb I've got. 
Hmm, who knows what time iPhone 3.0 will be available through iTunes? I want it before I go out tomorrow  (a.k.a early)
@PaulWestlake Apple are taking their time 
@tmorello really hope the album is also on Finlands iTunes also. Yesterday it didn't know your band.

Not liking still being stuck on freebie Twitterrific  Guess in the midst of a firmware update the Apple dudes may be slow on updates
@meara76  that's happened to two of my friends. Apparently it's a fairly common fault- they both got free replacements so get on to Apple!
How I wish #dongle was available on something other than/in addition to iTunes. I'm an unserved customer who wants to buy 
Still no Twitterrific Premium update in the iTunes tore  Hurry up Apple!
@Cranialstrain In Apple Mail, the RSS comes through with a couple of lines and then you click to visit the blog. Sorry

 For the first time ever, my iPhone crashed iTunes 3 times in a row. Also crashed &quot;Apple Moble Device Helper.&quot; WTF? Apple? Twitterrific?
@tmorello Am hunting and cannot find SSSC on iTunes, do I have to wait longer still? 
@korbz Got a feeling 3.0 will be released in the morning for each country. Chances are iTunes won't pick it up until tea time though 
My iTunes is not working 
@williger hmm, but i really love the curvy design of Palm Pre. Palm is almost extinct in India 
Team 1040 went back to the old programming of EPSN between 9 to noon. Makes sense since hockey is over. I guess its iTunes radio. 
What...my Zune is full  Ughhh,
very very bored  I can't buy LVATT on iTunes b/c my computer is jacked up  sad* maybe I can buy it on my itouch...
and maybe go to an Apple store to fix my Shuffle along the way. I can't work out without it 
Apple can't replace my exploded battery  time to order a new laptop battery.

@Cloud8745 hey Aaron can you give your old video to orther people on YouTube so they can upload it? I watches all the video on my iPhone

Previously the Apple/au store said 3.0 on the 17th. Now it says the 18th 
@androidcentral Browse the world! World's First Mobile Augmented Reality Browser.  Http://www.layar.eu Wish they made it for the iPhone 
@markbrown83  I think we'll be lucky if it's even then. Apple Australia now say the 18th... which would mean 1pm minimum 4 us 2mor. Grrr
@RyanStar wish I could by music from iTunes in BRAZIL... we're not allowed here, you know... 
Can't find the TweetDeck app in iTunes  Not in Canada?
@Aqua_Gypsy It's a really good Twitter client for Mac and PC. They said it came to iPhone/iPod Touch, but I can't find it 
@danyork how did you get it? Not in iTunes for me... 
@KateEdwards When you find it let me know, it's not on iTunes yet 
lordy lordy lordy! One whole day without XboxLive or Zune!  the renovation better be good!
Disappointing tech day, downloaded RayV &amp; then spent day in Apple store restoring my system, missed out on #140conf &amp; #IMU w/@chrisbrogan 
Switched from an Apple Store to direct shipping from AT&amp;T for my iPhone.  I do not expect to have one for at least two weeks, though. 
Can't find Tweetdeck on the App Store 
Pro tip: Don't buy your girlfriend or wife an iPhone. And for the love of God, don't tell her about iTunes gift cards. 3 a day is bad. 
i would get the IPhone 3.0 software but my IPod Touch broke  but i'm getting the new IPhone 3G S so that's awesome!
needs @jrdsctt on skype if he's not busy... iTunes crisis 
upset that my Zune won't connect, so that means no uploading new music to it 
My pics from #140conf today: http://bit.ly/141Z0v - sorry about the poor BlackBerry Bold shots. Left my SD card for proper camera at home 
@Tuglatonic Apple.co.nz site says you guys down under get it on the 18th I'm afraid 
@Megillo we submitted the updated Twitterrific 2.02 versions to Apple on Saturaday PM, we have no control over Apple approval process. 
@kirbythecorgi I love to try on new &quot;perfumes&quot; ... Mudhen, Cowpie, Horse Apple...  But I usually end up taking a bath too     Dott
@jschun sorry abt yr trouble, we submitted both Twitterrific 2.02 to Apple on Sat PM, we've no control over Apple's approval process. 
My iTouch died on me  Currently charging............................................... Sucks.
At The AirPort on data roaming... Wishing i had never come to BCN i got fired from The bar cause i didn't work on monday 
Still no 3.0 in iTunes. Come on Apple ..... 
I have a feeling Apple is going to pussyfoot with this 3.0 update. I need this now so I can go to sleep. 
OK, I'll stop pressing &quot;check for updates&quot; in iTunes - there wouldn't be enough time before work anyway 
@TUAW http://bit.ly/187Lcn is not worth it..sorry for the spam 
I don't wanna share my car stereo or my Zune with anyone. But my bed, that's a whole different story. I'm so loney... oh so lonely. 
So it would appear Apple are releasing iPhone 3.0 software 17 June 'American Time' as no update this morn 
Tried to download iphone OS 3.0 to no avail... Guess its not June 17th in Cupertino yet... 
@timbe2 I think Apple is teasing us ..... 
@timbe2 I think Apple is teasing us .....  (via @69Pwned) I think apple sucks.. Jk--but it makes me sad.
It's currently June 17th, 1:42AM and iPhone 3.0 software update is still not available!!  Come on Apple!! I want it now!!!
@dementia other than iTunes syncing?wala ata 
Damnit. I wanna getthe new update, but Ive got a longdrive 2morrow. Goin 2 bed w/ a sad face  Stupid Apple, I fart in ur general direction
Apple asks UPS to delay delivery of iPhone. Earlier, the tracker inidcated that it would arrive on Thursday: http://tr.im/oKUw 
My guess is Apple like to have a queue outside their stores... even the online ones 
AAAHHHH!!!!! Apple is holding my package for delivery at a &quot;later date&quot; I should have known they wouldn't deliver two days early  boooooo
*sigh* no love from Apple for developers  http://www.marco.org/122990476
Rumours OS 3 being released when Apple employees get into work (9am). Therefore 5pm uk time 
Software 3.0 is still not out!  What's wrong, Apple?
Good morning tweoples! When is june 17 in Apple world? I don't see the iPhone 3.0 update 
What a let down! Apple website now says the new iPhone software won't be ready until 6/18! 
@halcyondaze6 it looks like they are purposely delaying your delivery..  Damn UPS.. Apple used to ship Fedex from China... its way better
I already have 3.0 &quot;Gold Master&quot; on my iPhone but I still wanna restore just in case this one's more polished...but iTunes won't let me 
People should learn country codes and how to read urls... Apple US still has the date as the 17th.  Apple AU is the 18th  #iPhone
@JamFactory Bit gutted with that Apple OS3 page. I was expecting the Moon on a Stick on the new features page 
@unravel101 6am or 10am pst. Apple doesn't do midnight unfortunately. 
Apple says iPhone 3.0 doesn't come out until 8 AM  going to bed. NIGHT
Cant play songs in iTunes while syncing with iPhone 
Epic fail, they delayed the 3.0 release for my iPod Touch and iPhone 
@leneux nope.  Apple is prbly laughing at us all right now Bastards &gt;:0
@tuxplanet Have Spotify running on Wine (Ubuntu Netbook Remix) but periodically just stops working and requires a reboot to get it back 
Waiting for iPhone update 3.0    Hurry up Apple!
@greekshow I loved the song, can't find it on Itunes tho 
Bummer, i guess the release of iPhone OS3.0 will happen on June 17th Apple Time? 
Common Apple Already, do we really need to wait for the californians to wake up and Jam the servers? 
Apple puts brakes on early iPhone 3G S deliveries: http://is.gd/14ib9 - early? AT&amp;T is still &quot;processing&quot; my order 
Changed my mind about 'Spaces' on Apple - gets too confusing and some apps (Namely Microsoft apps) are of course not compatible... 
Aw  Apple's holding my 3G S hostage:  http://twitpic.com/7lych
iPhone OS3.0 : Apple delays until June 18th  http://tinyurl.com/nzm68t
@jmons  I've seen that stated but also after 6am in Cupertino (which is in 4 hours) so not for a while 
@loadedheart - But getting the Pre saves over a $1000 during a 2 year contract vs. the iPhone. Bye-bye thousand dollar bill 
@damiancb unfortunately not at my winblows PC with iTunes installed, so no idea 
@mschluepmann Seems that Apple didn't post the 3.0 Update yet. 
Got up early to download iPhone3.0. No show. Rumor is 1PM Eastern. Way to go Apple

Up and need to work...but iTunes isn't letting me upgrade to 3.0 yet! Why does it have to be on U.S time? 
@JustynaSaid Your iPhone got shipped out but Apple but a hold on all orders til Friday anyways 
@jemzkat I paid Apple, Apple sent to me.  And I still have the money I paid them in my bank account! Unless they're gonna take it later 
@chillyphilly You staying up/getting up early for Firmware 3.0? Apple finally turns on BT for you 2nd gen users. My 1st Gen misses out 
iPhone up early enough for me to get before work  damn you's at Cupertino.
Anyone already downloaded iPhone OS 3? Still not showing up in iTunes Store. 
@lou7788 not yet  it's not available according to iTunes
@garethslee Well according to The Register website, they reckon Apple have released a statement saying its going to be delayed 
17 June 2009, 3.53AM Cupertino Time (Apple), but Iphone 3.0 upgrade unavailable!!! 
Apple states that OS 3.0 will be available on the 18th: http://tinyurl.com/l9hx2p! Won't make envious my apero guests this evening 
@Klarabela No probs. Me too. iPhone has dust under the screen though  Have an appointment witth Apple to get it replaced hopefully.
Thanks Apple for holding my iPhone in Louisville, I really didn't want it early anyway 
Hejjjj!!!! - Apple, wake up!!!!!! 
Trying to update to 3.0 but iTunes won't cooperate!!! 
@gardnerisgod we submitted both versions of Twitterrific 2.02 to Apple on Saturaday PM, we have no control over Apple approval process. 
Palm Pre??...got one!.. albeit not mine..       Nice,. and iTunes thinks it's an iPod!  It'll need a faster brain next time tho...like me!
Apple slowed down the shipment. No early delivery 
Looks like I might have been wrong - All is I see Amazon releasing the mods to GPL code they use, not the actual Kindle source. 
Iphone 3.0 Still waiting - Apple 
@richardholt Hmm on Mac there's games like A Vampyre Story or Penumbra, and there's a handful of iPhone adventure. Nothing on PS3 
Coffee: check. Shower: check. iPhone update: not so much.  #squarespace
@carlonicora have you got 3.0 yet? I can't seem to get iTunes to understand that 2.2.x isn't the most recent update 
hmmm, looks like iPhone/iPod Touch 3.0 will be available around 11am MDT.  Too bad I won't be home till after 8pm tonight 
@pauleapo waited until after 3pm, tried iTunes and it says I have latest version 2.1.1 so no 3.0 yet 
@Caprica @ktml I've submitted a 3.0 compatible version of MoloPix to Apple, but still not approved... 
Hat schon jemand das iPhone OS 3.0 Software-Update auf dem Handy ... Bei mir is in iTunes &quot;tote Hose&quot; 
@faisalfarooqui Thats so confusing indeed. 17th or 18th?? Even Apple don't know for sure! 
@_Aztec_ App is definitely clean only problem is my shake feature is not working 
@dhreines I plugged mine into iTunes but no upgrade yet.  Tells me I have the latest version 
So Apple just rerouted my new macbook AND cancelled my 3GS pre-order AFTER my phone was shown as being upgraded so I can't reorder. WTF 
Silly MobileMe, duplicating all my contacts *sigh*. Further study of the sync order is needed 
@avidbookreader I updated iTunes the other day (I dl from the Apple website and then install). Can't find cell cord so can't updte to 3.0 
I've given up - Apple I was depending on you and you let me down 
@Destrownage I remember when MobileMe launched, they delayed it a day and it only worked sporadically once it did start 
@Harley_Dude Yeap I pre-ordered a 16GB black 3GS from Apple on Monday morning as soon as the delay rumors spread about AT&amp;T. Curve = ebay 
Updated iTunes this morn &amp; macbook stopped recognising iPhone! Took a lot of clearing to fix. Glad I know abiut ROOT and shell commands. 
@LondonElek Tony, I wanna buy sick music but don't have decks and hate Apple. Can I buy the MP3/ Ogg/ FLACs anywhere other than iTunes? 
@dayodetroit yah dude, Apple told UPS to hold my iPhone 3Gs in Louisville until Friday. They don't want any of us to have any fun! 
I want to buy the Bed Bugs iPhone game. 
I'm pissed off with Apple waiting for the 3.0 update 
@DaisyJo lol, it's an iTouch. I'm an Apple fanatic, but I'm not on AT&amp;T 
So pissed I missed the Peggle sale on iTunes a few days ago. Went down to $.99 now it's back up to $4.99. 
@hughsbeautiful How did you ge 3.0??  I can't get it yet... This makes me upset... do I need to get iTunes 8.2?
We'll, it's officially 1:00 PM and still no 3.0 update on iTunes   #iPhone3.0
erm, 6:01,  why!!! Apple, why!!!!
No #iphone 3.0 for me just yet  iTunes: &quot;2.2.1 is still the latest version.&quot; For a few more lingering minutes, perhaps.
@tedoe still not showing up for me on iTunes yet. 
@swiss_kris  Where did you get the upgrade from? I'm refreshing the Apple site and itunes and can't find it anywhere.  
I want the Palm Pre...  
@iamglenn @vannyyy @antonatron It's available in iTunes already. I have to wait to start downloading on my lunch break in an hour 
Downloading iPhone OS 3.0 right now, &amp; Apple told UPS to hold my phone until Friday

@mcleodd Doesn't look like Tethering is supported by Vodacom either  GRRRR - From the Apple Help -  http://bit.ly/4cgRn
@mcleodd we should have local cached versions of #Apple software for some of us with download speeds of 25kb/s 
What's up with iTunes? 
3.0 installd but iTunes store can't cope and won't respond! Got an expensive brick till i can get Apple's blessing to make it work grrr 
iPhone in emergency mode. Guess updating in iTunes and crossing my fingers that the unlock will hold didn't help. Now I NEED QuickPwn... 
@idiot_girl AHHH can not connect to the App Store to activate my phone 
Oh great! iPhone Update complete but now I can't connect to iTunes to activate it  Unknown Error. #iPhone
Woohoo - IPhone/IPod Touch OS 3.0 is available on iTunes - Pity it's not free  Visit my site:  http://www.ferigan.com/

@lbeard Connect your USB cable to your computer, although I can't connect to iTunes.  I have an iBrick 
3.0 update failed. Apple could not complete my iTunes Store request 
@creamsmith oh no  does it tell you that you can't connect to iTunes or something? Sam suggested I switch USB ports, and it worked.
@jimeh I'm super curious. Where are all the push activated apps? 
@dmhprior just sucking down 3.0 auto update via iTunes, it's going to end in tears 
Just updated my iPhone but I had to try 25-30 times trying to connect to iTunes Store before the phone was running again 
Sigh .. Apple's &quot;activation server&quot; is mocking me and my inactive iPhone 3.0 update 
@BadAstronomer Apple likes you more than me 
On second thought, looks like Apple is blowing this one all by themselves. Oh, the horror! The horror! No iPhone OS 3.0 install for me. 
@dubfire_scitec Apple's servers are overloaded 
@art176 Thanks! It was still a no-go.  iTunes just doesn't like me today 
First Time I wish I had an iPod Touch instead of an iPhone  Jailbreak Pleaseeee!
@rothbart That's AT&amp;T's fault, not Apple's.  But yeah, it's true 
NOOO! Apple's server is temporarily unavailable, as I was finishing the 3.0 download. That's what I get for waiting for dramatic effect 
@ryanodonnell damn, something told me to get the Apple ones but I listened to the store review 
Paid the Apple Tax and upgraded iPod Touch to 3.0

Freaking Apple servers are getting pwnd, so glad I already have 3.0 lol, spent 10mins just to agree with new T&amp;Cs 
Why does iTunes keep saying my network has been reset?!?!?!?! GAH!!!!!

iTunes store is being hammered, so can't get push notification enabled apps  Also, am I the only person who seriously dislikes tweetdeck?

@bkzzang @hyomini i think all the technology are striking out on me. now i have iTunes issue, it would just close down

@jessegoins the other day my iTunes kept getting stuck at a particular app during backup and I had to restart 
watching sisterhood of the traveling pants 2 with the family. stupid iTunes wouldn't download the new software today  SYTYCD in 9 minutes!

Aaaaaarrrrrrrrrrggggghhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!My iPod Touch won't restore!!!! unknown error 14, after trying to update to OS3.0 
Good bye Snow Leopard I will miss you but I cannot make an iPhone app on you and therefore I cannot make $$$ to feed you with new stuff 
Found out it was my laptop which hates me, not iTunes. Sorry iTunes 
Goodbye Sydney, goodbye Apple Store... I'll miss you 
Apple sucks!  Charging for the OS 3 update?  I guess cut and paste is worth $9.95   Here goes....
Message from Apple, we know you're waiting for MMS, it'll be a few hours! 
1,2,3 OPEN. iTunes won't open  naooo the silence is DEAFENING
@amigastu That's annoying as MobileMe syncs notes across Macs. Never mind. 1 less feature I can use 
my iPod is outta charge and iTunes is taking forever to load on my new laptop!! &gt;.&lt; Now I can't listen to Outta Here!!! Hahaha! 
Does Push Notification work on the iPod touch? I've gotten no notifications.  (I've got AP Mobile with notifications enabled)

@BGostelow hey mate what was that web address that told you what you can do wit 3.0again? btw, p2p n booth only works on the 2nd G iTouch 
@dre4mkid Aww man. That sucks. I'm thinking Apple's servers are too jammed up at the moment. We might need to wait a day or two to go 3.0 
I'm sad again. I can't update my iTouch. 
Looks like my iPhone is restoring. Thank the lord for that, taking forever though. And all my data is stuck on my Mac. I want a Pre 
Using iSync to sync my old Sony Ericsson is annoying. I miss you iTunes sync and I've only been without you for 13 hours

Hoping to use my #squarespace cash to get me an Apple TV, but #squarespace needs to pick me first 
Made the good finanical decision to use my employee cell discount, but now I'm not an iPhone user.   Can't wait till I can get a Palm Pre
Domino's gives me a free pizza if my delivery is late, Apple.  Can I get a $25 iTunes gift card or something? #applefail ? #upsfail ? 
@joshkocurek iPhone/iTouch only tho   Strange they don't have a more mobile friendly link to that story :/
Can anyone confirm that Ocarina works for the iPod Touch 1st Gen? I don't mind not being able to use a mic. I @replied Smule, but nothing 
@VetrinaGirl &quot;insufflating iTunes&quot;, really starting to hate it now 
SiriusXM iPhone app is lame, no #NASCAR and no Howard Stern  Why would I pay 12.99 a month for that?
Ugh, now Apple Store AND Fido are saying customers looking to upgrade to the 3G S who aren't eligible for upgrade pricing are out of luck 
had to buy two songs involving Mickey Mouse on iTunes for a project I'm working on...now I'm broke on iTunes. 
newsflash: Palm Pre is no longer spinning as long when I twhirl it on the desktop - smooth back is being worn matte and causing friction 
Ugh, streaming Pandora cuz I'm burnt on my playlists so I'm eating my Touch battery &amp; my charger is @ home 
@routesy: Hopefully Apple will hop on that soon! 
Why can't I delete the icons for the Apple iPhone apps? The addition of voice memo means just another icon on my deadpool screen. 
Software update beachballed my MacBook... It's hosed.  iPhone is acting up as well. Bad day for my Mac things.
@hectorramos Extracted it and it created a new folder called Payload. iTunes still won't select the new file 
I gave it a few to be sure, but it totally sucks. Apple keyboard keys are much mushier now then the one I bought in Feb. Mediocre at best 
At an awesome motel outside of Pembine, WI. iPhone is Running on WiFi, no cell service up here! 
@clielasus - yes way! It died at first startup and was just beeping so it needs to go back to Apple, have to wait for a replacement now 
@technosailor good story about blackberry &amp; location services.  Palm Pre battery would have died long before you could ever locate it.  
@HollaWalla Nope - need a data recovery company. Apple says hard drive crashed 
@philhawley I am having to reload iTunes and all my music back onto my laptop 
Complete reset, re-install and re-sync and things appear to be working. Nice UX Apple 
Just bought an Apple bluetooth keyboard, really excited.  You could have paid for this, #squarespace.  You could have 
@da_chosen01 the update took me forever &amp;&amp; I lost everything bc I had to delete iTunes &amp;&amp; restore my phone 
@tromboneforhire Should have used Zune Pass.  (But, yeah, the record companies are crazy.)
Lousy traffic driving through Columbus OH tonight. Tested the 'traffic' feature on Palm Pre's Sprint GPS Nav - no alternate suggestions. 
@sternshow 1800+ reviews of the new #Sirius app are in &amp; about 99% say without u they r not paying the monthly fee.  App fa fa fa failed 
Hooray! Leaving work at 6:30.  And I didn't win an iPhone gift card   #squarespace #trackle
Sadly, pensioners can't afford Apple prices, so it will most likely be replaced by a windows desktop 
My iPhone updates arnt downloadin..  Humm?do y no this new update ables u to copy n paste hehe... Dam iTunes!
got yelled at cuz Apple sucks 
@theRealCrazy  I went to the Apple store in the promenade today and They said even though we reserved it gonna be a long line 
Just got off the phone with Apple Support, but got no support. Because it cost $49.99!?!?! WTF? My sound effects won't show up in iMovie 
My macbook has some terrible cracks on the bottom case.  Apple wouldn't fix it because they said I dropped it although I didn't. 
I wish I had iTunes, but I can't afford it. 
I think my iTouch has died 
is tweeting from Windows Mobile - it's interesting to note how expensive the apps can be when you compare to the App Store 
Arrrgghh Apple why do I have to close an app whenever I want to reply to a text on my iPhone 3.0. Where's that jailbreak 
@applevacations I wish I was leaving on a Apple Vacation this weekend 
Gotta find the charger for my Logitech bluetooth headphones to test with iPhone 3.0. Oh why didn't Logitech use mini USB? 
Need a book to read on my flight... Since JetBlue doesn't have WiFi  Any suggestions? I'm gonna try to pick one up at Borders or Walmart.
http://twitpic.com/7rfx2 - Apple you're breaking my heart 
drew the short straw and will be standing in line tomorrow morning at the Apple store 
&quot;the iTunes Store is temporarily unable to process purchases.&quot; What, no apology for the inconvenience?

Starting to have buyers remorse with this Palm Pre,  Ohhh well, at least I have 30 days to take it back to the Sprint store!
Where is my @beejive_im  update  Come on Apple.... #applefail
@kylefox takes me 2 hours to get to the Vancouver Apple store 
If you use the iPhone Live365 app, the 3.0 update breaks it.   A new Live365 app that works is waiting in Apple's approval queue.
Best iPhone OS 3.0 feature so far: email server search! Worst: I lost my YouTube bookmarks during the update and had to redo em all 
exactly 2 months ago all the retailers near me stopped selling Apple Fanta  even though they had no prob getting it off their shelves.WHY?
@LuvArabians You need to purchase the Touch update - $9.99 from the iTunes store.  It's only the iPhone that gets the update free. 
aww. it's over.  i love that song. when i'm not broke, i'm gonna buy it on iTunes.
@frankfil think so. Now I can't redeem things from the App Store 
@aryayush Not seeing Glyphboard on my App Store

Day One Palm Pre Hunt  Palm Pre sold out at 5 locations... trying again next mon 
Just splurged on some iTunes music...now I only have 6 hours of sleep to look forward to  really going to bed now.
iPhone 3.0's playlist sorting is all messed up. playlists beginning with ! show up at the bottom, and sorting by date added is broken too 
@filmfreak75 I dowloaded my missing app on iTunes and it didn't charge me at all.  But I found out the MMS is not working. 
@nielsschooneman Apple doesn't provide news beyond &quot;Approved&quot; and &quot;Rejected&quot;  I hear that right now the wait is about 3wks from submis.
@4ND3RS I guess that means that Apple gave up on CalDAV 
Ok, new Blackberry and Internet keeps going down. Sick of calling Sprint Tech Support 
@paulshadwell I keep looking at the Apple page waiting to see a similar deal for the old 3G as in the states but no joy 
My brother's iTouch has wifi! Of course I can only use it when he's asleep

iPhone OS 3.0! Very excited, but there's no iPod touch 3g jailbreak for 3.0 yet 
@reneritchie You're a brave man! I don't go anywhere in the rain!  I wish I lived near an Apple store. 
@micaheljcaboose all I know is that I want flash.  Apple is against the idea even though Adobe is gung-ho.
Hmm...can anyone else get Shake to Shuffle...shuffling...outside of the iPod App on their iPhone? That's the only time it seems to work! 
now cuz Apple called, I lost the surprise   I'm gonna sue! Where's that Kramer's advocate? This is outrageous, egregious and unheard of!
Apple just brought out umbrellas for the first 14 people in line. They are loaners and there is no logo 
A watched kettle never boils apparently. A watched iTunes update is based around the same scientific principles! 
We're prep'ing #tomeraider for #iphone and are scared of the Apple rejection risk. Removing the wordnet dictionary  because of &quot;fuck&quot; 
A Coke bottle promised me a free iTunes download, then sent me an invalid redeem code. Stupid lying bottle 
My new HTC Magic Android handset just turned up, which is good! Sadly, my number doesn't get transferred until Monday, which is bad 
Middleton o2 was all out of Black 32Gig iPhone 3GS's 
Just noticed MobileMe not syncing as well 
Getting ready to head to the Alderwood Apple Store for the iPhone 3G S launch....  and it just started raining! 
Putting all my songs back on my Itunes. 
I synced tvshows from the istore to my touch and now I can't find them. Itunes def said touch had video on it before I unplugged 
Currently at the Apple Store waiting in line, 1 person in front of me.  Unfortunately there's a separate line for people who reserved it. 
So I can sync music to my iPhone, but if I try to sync any app iTunes crashes  is there any way to clear all the app data from the phone?
@Howardsternshow why isn't Howard on the Sirius iPhone app? 
@cindybrock that stinks. Have you tried AVI? iTunes may want to convert it no matter the file type. 
Kind of makes me sad that I'm not lining up for a new iPhone. Then again, not even released in IE yet &amp; no Apple store here 
@harrislacewell  How come I couldn't find your book on Amazon? Want it on my Kindle 
I wish apple let you sync your contacts to iTunes. Since I jailbreak every time I have to upgrade/restore I always lose them 
Apple's safety town graduation cancelled due to rain 
Potentially no internets for the weekend at home.  Thank god for the Metro and the iPhone+Edge network (I never thought I'd say that...).
When Palm Pre will hits Europe??? 
This morning my iPhone became an iBrick. Looks like the dev version of OS3.0 expired, but iTunes keeps insisting it is up to date. 
@TUAW But for US numbers only 
Is not standing in line at the Apple STore.  
Unless UPS pulls some sort of package routing Hail Mary, this weekend I'll be playing with my iBone instead of my iPhone. 
Just found out his iPhone 3GS was in Sylmar at 5:55 am on it's way to Jeffrey's work. I'll see it Sunday tho 
Apple now supports the MMS messaging but apparently it won't be available via at&amp;t until late summer...How ironic. I am bummed 
Oh, no! iTunes says that because of volume, it may take up to 48 hrs to process activation!?! You gotta be kidding me  
iphone 3GS at the Apple Store fail so far is a Fido problem 
Nice Touch - AT&amp;T Customers, dial *639# on your 3G iPhone to see if you are eligible for the 3GS upgrade... (via @nicholasdr) I'm Not 
@joereist I don't have an Apple Store   And I found out lastnight the only AT&amp;T store near me only had 4 32 white iPhones.

@Delphine1974  I'm sorry. Waiting sucks!!!! FWIW, I couldn't even get in the Apple store today because I wasn't buying and iPhone.
If it took Apple 3 versions to get the iPhone right, is Apple the new Microsoft? Say it ain't so 
Having my first problem w/the Pre. Touchscreen isn't working in some places and I can't hear people when they're talking. 
Hmm....strange. Ever since I upgraded to the new iPhone OS 3 for my iPod Touch, my volume slider disappears on me every so often. 
My trip to the Apple store ended in failure. The line was too long for me to stand in during my lunch break. 
@sofiafontes it's almost as if they posted my iTunes library... 
@ashytaka EXCEPT!!!!! Our IT department blocked iTunes' internet access...so I can't activate it until i get home 
Found old version of iTunes on web &amp; installed on old PC. Now doing from scratch restore and jailbreak of 2G iPhone again!

@bigepaz BTW- I decided to wait till next year for a new iPhone   I'm Apple comes out with a table/netbook thingy to spend my $$ on..
@eldade @openhebrew did you guys figure out how to fix caller id? Apple seems to have changed this since 2.2 
Apple Store only had white phones left, luckily my case covers it and you cant tell   When wife ran in ATT store they only had 2 white 32s
@mmWine Does your Apple TV lock up / act funky? Both of mine do after about a week or so and have to be unplugged and restarted. 
@nixterrimus I went to the Apple store to get one, and they only had white 32GB models left 
Got my iphone and have to call Apple - just like the first one. Once they're activated; they're great.  
Not what I wanted to happen on the way to the Apple Store   Just not my day today.... http://mobypicture.com/?7gtirg
My #iPhones are named after horses, @brenden Seabiscuit was just retired  for Giacomo.
After 4 solid hours on the phone with Apple and AT&amp;T, I have no 3G working on iPhone. Indefinitely, I can make calls, and that's it. 
Guh, bus wifi is down and I think the unlocking ate my iTunes rentals. 
is stuck in line at the Apple Store waiting to buy some bling for his phone. 
r @codinghorror I would concur with your statement regarding iPhone, and iTunes. iTunes on the mac flys; iTunes on the PC is a dog 
emptying Trash with thousands of duplicate songs from iTunes. hope i did this correctly. 
iPhone joy is shortlived. The Apple &quot;expert&quot; deleted more than half of my contacts during the transfer. Including my date from Tues night 
@z3bbster thanks for the Palm Pre update - i know a few people with them.. one thing i know is that they are not happy with battery life 
@Kaiser_Machead hahaha yeah i always enjoy going to computer stores. especially those of the appleian descent. --but tek serve =

Looking for novels to read on my Kindle on vacation. The most recent two Hugo winners don't have Kindle editions. 
@jsuplido aargh! It's not available on the Philippine App Store 
Seems Apple changed the USB ports on the alu macbook (5,1) so that it puts out - pwr than before. Need powered hub now for audio ixface

@palm Unfortunately Sprint will not match my current phone &amp; data plan- it looks like I'm stuck with the BlackBerry Pearl. So no Palm Pre 
@MilfordTimes I think Apple/AT&amp;T like to see how many hoops they can make customers jump through. It's frustrating sometimes 
Apple realllllllllly needs to give us the ability to reinstall backed up app data on an app-by-app basis. I miss my Palm.  #iphone #apple

@Tetanus Apparently   I had assumed the ~1 year delay on Push Notifications was Apple implementing it over SMS etc. rather than polling.
I miss the people from the old days...Gametap, Helio, Htc...I don't have any nerd friends anymore 
@jzdziarski Fuck Apple, let us Redeem codes for the App Store. And while you at it, let us use iTunes gift cards for the App Store too! 
@manomio too bad BASIC had to be removed ... darn Apple! what are they afraid off?  #C6W
