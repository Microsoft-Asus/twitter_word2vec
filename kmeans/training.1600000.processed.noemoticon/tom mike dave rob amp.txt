All my love goes out to Mike Tyson on the loss of his 4yr daughter 
Mike was robbed and I feel terrible for him. 
Nobody won my respect more than he who swung back after having fallen. This shouldn't have happened to Iron Mike.  http://bit.ly/dHbI3
You know the sad thing is that this will backlash on Jeff and David both.... 
@iamdiddy I'm glad you made it and everything. But I haven't seen where you mentioned the loss of Mike Tyson's 4yr. old daughter. 
My thoughts are with Mike Tyson and his family through this tragic time 
I feel bad for Mike Tyson's daughter and I hope she gets well. 
@patricksiazon Patty cakes! Congrats to TSL, I haven't seen you guys play in a while  Mike misses you guys

@SteveChaiGuy Your Steve Chai sounds awesome. *wishes she had one now* But I'm stuck with: Idon'tknowwhatdamnbrandcoffeethisis  
I'm very conflicted here.  I really like Mike but I still have feelings for Darrin.  It's really complicated.  I don't know what to do. 
@lexie_98 Kevin can't leave work until 2

Home from Jack's now, can't say I'm too happy about that either 
@Big_Jim I so much want to see the screen adaptation of Kick Ass, but once i found out Nick cage was in it, my heart sank

No more spending the day chatting with Steve on the computer   Now what I am I going to do at work?
I wanna see that movie &quot;Keith&quot; with JMcCartney in it! It looks sooo good. But none of the video stores here carry it 
@Bill_Nye why so quiet lately? 
Stu is actually SEVERLY sunburnt....it hurts!!! 
Praying for pressure on brain 2 subside, for brain seizures 2 stop &amp; for tumors 2 go - Dan is comfortable but still has niggling cough 
Ps BGT was both fab and sad, I thought Greg was awesome, sad he's gone but a child will always win in that situation sadly 
Headed home ... Charlie's at the vet 
@elephantparty Ha! Thanks Bryan! And don't remind me about the state budget issues.  Actually, Steve only has 6 staffers in 3 offices.
@BillFanning Bill, likewise it was a pleasure- next time we should spend more time talking  #ims09
@miss_r I can't get one either because of the dog. I'm pretty sure the bunny wouldn't survive a struggle with Tom 
@ragavin  is there anything Brian or I can do?

I miss my uncle Mark and his dogs

Wanted to head to the star bar, but doesn't want to go alone.   I don't think Tim likes my friends.
THIS is why I miss NYC: http://www.gayzofourlives.com/ -- Jim &amp; David's summer party - Erin, Jim, Scott, Sam, TenTen, Marisa, Chris...
