@Catstandfield Jammy bugger I'm starving and the BBC menu is crap today, not a happy bunny...

@cjdurham yeah me too but the BBC must be gutted! Seriously though why can't Mosley just give in now...this makes me sad 
If the breakaway F1 does go ahead, I'm worried that Sky are going to buy all rights to it. Seems like the sort of thing they'd do. 
Why did I just see a propaganda healthcare ad pushing BHO's plan as the solution on FOX News?
