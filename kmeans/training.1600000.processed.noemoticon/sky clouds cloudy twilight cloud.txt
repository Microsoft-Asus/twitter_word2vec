@Patronia hah i think new moon is alot easier to read than twilight. less than 100 pages to go 
@aholt21 it's nice when intelligent lighting is actually intelligent 
random trees, clouds and mountains generated and loss of frame rate kept to a minimum 
@gypsyroadhog and yourself as well  it's a bit chilly here on this side o' the pond too, but bright and sunny blue skies!
