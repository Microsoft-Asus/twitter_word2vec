One final bounce and goodbye to Jon and Tory, then back home 
@JessObsess I was telling fan girls how Kate and Ryan AREN'T dating, and how Kate wasn't the one Ryan cheated with  (i knows the truth!)
still honestly feels really sad about all the &quot;Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8&quot; drama...it's been one of my favorite shows 
We got a phone call this morning that I really didn't want to get. Jon's mom passed away this morning 
Jon could totally say Mannies and Peddies and I would shut my fat face about it.
