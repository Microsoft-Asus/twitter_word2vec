sorting through 5gb of music to but some on my new MP3 as i broke my old one 
@chriskeating re the labour general secretary meeting with Labour PM's aide - I posted the very same on facebook. BBC gone downhill 
It's not nice when the battery of your MP3 player runs flat in the middle of a show. 
ugh... I hate it when I forget to charge my MP3 player and end up having to go to work in silence 
Just figured out my local MP is rubish, I knew that anyway, but this confirms it  http://is.gd/tp2r I don't agree with his voting record! 
@missgiggly what happened hon? 
@RMantri It is sad that turnout has not been good in elections till now. I am sure, we will have a govt. we will hate 
Guess it would help if I'd fix the link to the MP3 file so actually worked... 
@aliwildgoose I was totally angered by a lot of the MSP storyline.

Going to sleep...waking up at 5 to review a little more before my Government exam at 7:30. 
@reese015 one quick question since i've never mailed MEP. should i sign mail with my full name? (sry if question seems dumb  )
With confidence in MPs already at an all-time low, the media really are hammering the nail in the coffin for faith in democracy 
@bonnieroseleigh awww, I'm sorry hon  you work on getting well
Going through hell trying to convert my digital music collection from WMA to MP3 format

@chibinezu I don't think so, sorry hon 
@EvilSue The camera is a mere 10MP - it's the stitched images that can be too large for jpg format 
@nkb He's only wuit his post as aide - not as MP though 
@lornaparsons my brain reads BPN as BNP 
Worse thing about the MP expenses thing? A guy on news yesterday, saying he'll probably vote BNP next time - bad times 
Missing my boyfriend, who's in Strasbourg because of a some European Counil thing... 
Although it's funny the MPs have made a complete fool of themselves what worries me is the rise of smaller parties aka the BNP... Oh dear 
My MP3 player died 
@Tory_x me too me too 
Two halogen bulbs have blown in the living room this pm, &amp; they are not easy to replace. If only I was an MP with an expense account 
Just received a leaflet from the BNP - our letterbox is sullied, I think I should scrub it 
Waiting for the silly MP3 player to charge 
hon here i am, i  miss you too  
@redvers oh no hon 
Having checked the lists, it appears that my MP is not one that has taken the piss with #expenses. Better dismantle the gallows 
I'm worried that there is not one single MP that has not claimed bogus expenses! 
I'm worried that there is not one single MP that has not claimed bogus expenses!  http://bit.ly/da3AN
@thepistol thats awesome! if i had the time and money i would fly in from michigan just to join one of the PPP! 
@1outside Such is the price of free speech.  Our British National Party (or BNP) is having a bit of a leaflet frenzy at the moment. 
Just had a discussion with a mild mannered colleague at work about the BNP leaflet and it turns out she's a massive racist 
@natalieben Something's got to be done to stop the extremists - I really fear BMP and UKIP are going to do well

@heawood not like the good old days when posties might throw all non Labour leaflets in the bin 
So everyone who wants to deal with Border Agency HAS to go through their MP. Surely, that's not their job?

Its hard to get a good Google listing for wills in Wiltshire because one of the local MPs is called Wills

@bztak1020 actually, my friend gave me the files today! lol but those are all CDA files... do u know how to convert them to MP3? 
my MP5 is broken  
ANC has been good, not today tho..funeral at 2pm 
I signed up to get BNP leaflets through my mail so i could laugh at them, now I'm scared in case my house gets bombed   Thoughts?
trying to download movies to my MP4 but it won't work! i'm so frustrated. i've been trying it for more than an hour 
too many people of my acquaintance have contemplated voting BNP, I am very very sad 
@chris_coltrane The Lib Dems have been much closer to my own views, of late. The Greens seem to get more silly and unrealistic every day 
@foxandfriends Government in charge of any company is a very bad idea! 
Doh! Left my MP3 player at the hotel. That's my second one this month. 
@crystalsinger I hope so too. French Prime Minister said we must prepare for the worst though and I fear he's right 
Just watched a &quot;Conservative&quot; ad that inspires hate. I can't vote for a party that can't talk issues and resorts to personal attacks 
Just veen given a leaflet telling me not to vote for the BNP. I must look like I'd be easily duped into voting for facsists 
who can access PPP here? I can't since this morning  http://plurk.com/p/xtpfy

@MrEyekandy I'm really sorry about racial profiling  Cops are BNP cunt pigs.
@Lizloz I'll be voting for an independent I think - really worried that the BNP might get some seats if people withhold votes 
@salandpepper  I reckon all the poeple who say they vote Tory cos Lib Dems wouldn't get in ACTUALLY voted for Lib Dem, they would get in.
Just realised the worst thing about full time work: I can't watch Prime Minister's Questions today 
@happyhero Bad luck - she's resigned from Cabinet, but she's said she's continuing as an MP 
 PC world had a good deal on a cybershot 12MP although they is sold out now, I'll look around and see what's available elsewhere.
The Prime Minister appears to be unable to answer the questions put to him  #PMQ's
Brown just made the point in PMQs that DC has no policies. This is true, but GB has no Cabinet. 
PMQs was a big let down 
I just read the words 'Rebel MP' and now I've got bloody 'Street Tuff' in my head 
Wow. Blears goes also, and I missed it ....... http://bit.ly/xutim

so miserably sick. going to school to turn in a functions project and run for NHS VP. @ChelseaRB absolutely, as long as I'm not sick 
I hope everyone will be out voting tomorrow. Lib Dem are getting my vote. I can see loads of ppl going for people like UKIP though 
@sunday Worse - the BNP have their first County Council seat. No one can pretend ignorance - only racist would vote BNP. 
@rudedoodle I dunno, I think stepping down pretty much forces an election. Which means tories 
@Nealea European elections yesterday...Brown clings on by a cuticle. Labour's reduced me from a proud socialist loser to a sad undecided 
@HannahBucke Tory across the board 
no no, it's a brand new spanking product, no keywords, no desc... but i found a way to put ANY item in my store as an MP product 
@PrettiGirl10  so sorry hon. i was really hoping she'd stick around.
@Hollowbabes Yes, but a Tory alternative won't be any better. 
Election results not good for Labour! 
@RupertRead4MEP Wish I lived in Narridge. The Tories dominate here in Suffolk Coastal 
so i figured out how to link my PC with my Xbox... but i cannot watch MP4s 
@grooveworksENT Most def! I'm still waitin on my MP3s 
after looking at all those photos taken on dslr, my cam photos look like crap even with 12MP 
@bethwhite1 okay. Labour's screwed. I'm sad  #Lol@Boris  I haven't seen the link yet - when I go on pc!

@andreinadeleo yeah, tomorrow PPP, but I will be at school

I hate to say it, but it is Labour's fault that the BNP are making gains  #eu09
@kateblogs its the Yorkshire/Humber region due in 10-15mins, saying BNP could have the 6th seat 
What is happening in Yorkshire? Looks like BNP have got a seat  #eu09
nothing for BNP in eastern regions  @mhoobag1
On the one hand the BNP severely lost out and the Greens gained 3% but on the other hand no Green seat for the East 
BNP so far have nearly 7% of the vote  Turn out so far 35%, although that's only over two regions.
up too late watching results of #eu09 from holiday - desperately hoping home yorkshire region has not returned a BNP MEP 
BNP doubled their share of the vote in Barnsley... gawd

Shouting at the screen doesn't seem to change the BNP result 
UKIP are doing far too well for comfort 
@pickledpolitics It appears it's cos # of voters decreased. BNP # of votes actually decreased but total share increased... 
BNP has definitely got one seat, they might also get another 
@pw_official This part of Yorkshire does not want the bloody BNP representing me. So upset about this. Disgraceful indeed. 
BNP get a Euro MP.  It's a sad, sad day for Britain 
@faridahpeach Me too. Especially since I read that Greens only needed 15, 683 more votes to take that seat from the BNP. Not much at all 
who the hell voted BNP and Conservstives in Wales?? Shame on you. Hoped #Plaid Cymru would get more than a 1% increas 
BNP get an MEP? I'm currently ashamed to be English and even remotely associated with that lot 
Just got in from a few drinks in town to find that the BNP have got a seat in Yorks&amp;Humber. I guess I didn't vote Lib Dem hard enough. 
@sirwiggum I'm just horrified there's not a better way to express disillusionment - apathy is unacceptable but so are the BNP 
No Lib Dem seat for Wales 
bnp euro parliament seat = not cool. this is why i'm angry at mutti and vatti for forgetting to vote

The BNP candidate said it was the &quot;first step to freedom&quot; from EU &quot;dictatorship&quot;. 
is heartbroken about the BNP seat. 
BNP has won its 1st Member of the EU Parliament in the Yorkshire &amp; Humberside region w/ our candidate Andrew Brons winning 120,139 votes. 
I cannot believe that the BNP got a seat in Yorkshire for the European elections. That's honestly atrocious  badtimesindeed.

Banners is saddened at the news the BNP has won its first MEP. Not a good day for this country

It was a grim day for Yorkshire, absolutely disgusted we let the BNP in

@mholden89 You mean because of the BNP? Sounds like the NW will have one too.. 
I wish people were more vocal about MP's, MEP's &amp; politics in general before elections &amp; not voice their thoughts after the fact 
@macjw2 this MEP they've put in place is ex NF! waiting for someone to paint a st davids star on my door 
East Midlands: Tory 2, Labour 1, Lib Dem 1, UKIP 1. over 100 000 BNP votes though 
@RuthieCakes And the BNP sneak through the apathy door. 
Oh my god BNP, suck my dick, seriously.

@forwardadam I know! Election via Twitter I say! I must say I am disappointed with the Liberal Democrat turnout tonight 
@josiefraser same here - but getting a bad feeling now that I'll be staring at his mush making a speech.   cannot have a Nazi as my MEP
Results slow coming in, but Labour are getting the drubbing they deserve!! BNP got a seat....not GOOD 
Bitterly disappointed that the BNP are getting 50-60,000 votes in some locales - not encouraging 
No Labour in the SW 
@davidottewell BBC has called it unofficially for BNP 
I should have punched the people distributing BNP fliers near the uni.  That would have made me feel better.
Looks like Griffin has won the BNP a 2nd seat in NW. Sad day in British politics 
2 seats for the BNP then.. 
Sounds like 2 BNP seats now. That's pretty disturbing/disgusting. 
so close to keeping the BNP away from the north west 
2 BNP MEP's ...... this is not good 
BNP win second seat   with the salaries and platform that goes with it. Cheery note to go to bed.
My god, what the hell is wrong with you Britain? We're such a pitiful bunch of Eurosceptic tabloid-reading BNP-voting scumbags 
 Man I hate the BNP. The Greens are so great and its horrible to see them grouped down with such a horrible party in seats ._.
not the BNP 
Though it is shocking that the BNP is consistently higher than the party I voted for (libertas)... 
BNP elected in Yorkshire. Fucking great 
BNP have 2 MEPs  I am very disappointed UK! #fb

BNP....European parliament seat! what happened 2 equality? what is this country coming 2? sad times 
birds are singing, light is pouring in. I should go to bed, think tomorrow with the PLP is going to be a long one! so sad about the BNP 
Not impressed by 2 BNP seats in #eu09 
@Jemz_ADQ why would you? 
@SylviaDiscount ah yes it most definitely is, I am so not in love with the police or the DPP for that matter 
@mclife512 Thanks for the reco! I will check out that website for decorating ideas. I don't see a lot of DIY decorators here in MLA. 
Thanks to complicated windows at Parliament, my laptop got slightly rained on. 
Over half the population think disabled people are &quot;inferior&quot; and we've just elected our first BNP MEP - it's a great time to be English 
I have to say it's very saddening that 'Yes Minister' still reflects how cabinet ministers appear to behave under Labour 
@Libs_1987 i no yeah fuck knows what im gunna wear i have no money to but anything 
it would be very awesome of the 5MP camera on the E72 had Carl Zeiss lens...I doubt it will though. 
@christineburns - it was knowing that negativity like the BNP would gain a foothold that I was campaigning for inspiration in Manchester 
It is a little telling that the BNP fall back on WW2 to attempt to stir some misguided patriotism. Pity it seemed to work 
Ahhh... I'm confused which MP3 player will I buy..

@JelliBeen92 nooo, you posted your fic whilst PPP is on, now I'm torn  
@dorlancognac absolutely true. It is partly why we have the Tories in pwr now. Liberal sponsorship scandal had us turf them out of pwr.
