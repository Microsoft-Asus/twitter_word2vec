Just finished Angels and Demons.  Really good book  Now I have to go see the move, but I have a feeling they ruined a lot of it 
Watching the Sox...we don't deserve this game. We keep screwing up. 
 cant afford to see Angels and Demons, so i watched it for free: http://tr.im/lvBu
not gonna lie, the Twins bullpen misses Pat Neshek something fierce...and so do I 
@pistonsnews Once I think about it, I donno which teams Detroit would move out. Probably Lions and maybe Tigers. Or.. :O Pistons? 
Couldn't watch the Sox live on TV (Sunday) so I avoided I-net and sports shows to watch &quot;Red Sox in 2&quot; just see them lose at 1:00am. 
The Yankees beat my Twins once again with a lead off homer, what in the world is going on? 
Saw Angels &amp; Demons last night. That is a movie inspired by the book, but in no way true to the book. And the final brand? C'mon. 
@overflowshelves It was a good weekend for Yankee's fans!  But not for baseball moms - all games&amp;practice rained out this weekend 
The NEW Yankee Stadium is amazing!  But, I miss the ol' ballpark. Just not the same  Goooo Yanks! -Bri
Gotta break out my broom again... Red Sox sweep Blue Jays... 1/2 a game out of first place in the AL East.  Stupid Yankees keep winning 
is going home.  Noone wants to see Angels &amp; Demons with me.  
#ilovemovies but I haven't even watched Angels &amp; Demons yet!! 
@msilve No, they are not playing at CitiField tonight   I wish, though!  And who said I ever wanted to visit you? ;)
Just watched Orlando take another one, and now we're watching the Mariners give one away... 
I am sad. I can't get married if I wanted to. I don't have a job. The Angels are losing. Critics are talking smack about Favre. 
@mxrss I don't get to make the call on what tickets\games we get  but I am a Padres fan not a A's fan but a free ticket is well you get it
aish. i didn't get my majors 
Just beat @MYsportsphotog 16-14. Bucs (me) vs Jets. Sanchez was solid but coughed it up late to give me the win. Bucs offense = awful. 
trying to figure out how this works and sad the Cats lost 
Going to see Angels and Demons tonight. It better not scare me!! 
@DamienEstreich Brought back memories mentioning the mixer~of being pushed into Angels desk,with full glass of beer,not my fault,desk F'd 
didnt get to see a Shorebirds game 
Watching the Braves game--hope they win. We need a win sooooo badly 
Cards lost by 1. 
Marlins can't pull it off  Congrats. Mets.
Driving up to Anaheim to drop my sister off  Shes goin to colorado for 10 weeks

Votto on the DL    #reds
At Citifield for the rest of my life 
@Kiakaha13 up at 4am to see Chiefs get hammered.. that really sucks 
Votto is on the DL     And Arizona is losing 6-0 in the 2nd! Unbelievable.
finished the Redlegs 5K this morning w/ a gun time of 21:40. I can't find the online results to see what my actual chip time was. 
@derekallard looks like I have to eat my words about your Jays sweeping the Sox at their home  
I guess I should go clean out the pollen from the pool since the Sox game was a bust 
still cant believe that the blue jays came from behind and beat the redsox 
@youngyonny a lot it's her whole mixtape at least 13 songs enough to make a mixtape  she's heated too! I know her song Amazin was leaked
@Bytor2112 oh of course I remember those awesome jerseys! wish I could go to one of those Hawks/Sox day games 
How is Soriano the only #Cubs player near the top of the All Star voting? theRiot is my all star!!!! It's a shame Rammy has been hurt 
Freaking Cubs getting cheap runs on the dodgers 
I wanna be at Fenway tonight seeing DMB! 
wow Dodgers got shut out 
David Ortiz is 2 for his last 32 w/ one double and 13 strikeouts. Sox are going to have to give up a young arm or 2 at the deadline 
Wishes he had tickets to the DMB concert at Fenway tonight 
Manny 4th in all-star votes NL...Really cnt get behind that 
I'm closing the media room and watching the Astros on Gameday...t9 7-2 PIT 
Depressing.   I guess our hopes for a championship this year rest in the hands of the Tribe and Browns!
C'mon Bombers 
Angels lost  no fireworks 
too bad. The Yankees game is shown on german TV and it looks like I'm not at home. 
@kevinrose  But the Giants lost.  
I want to watch Angels and Demons!  I have a cough 
shame about the Chiefs this weekend 
@dianewah im back in NL

Injuries are KILLING my AL fantasy team.  First Vlad and now Grady. 
Wnna see Angels and Demons,. these sems wont let me! 
@ammyliz, enjoy watching Smoltz for me... i can't be at the game; i have to work 
Greinke allows 3 runs for the first time all season. 
@Doumit41 That sucks 
And so it begins again.  At least i only have to go into Habs another 9 Times ever... And one of them is to collect results!
says Shoot Yanks lost  http://plurk.com/p/xh5sa
I havn't been able to watch a #cubs game in forever and this is what happens?! Dogers 5 Cubs 0 - bottom of the first. 
@hailey_letang Celtics do have a waiting list.  I finally was offered tix but had to turn them down.   Sox people wait decades too.
@greggrunberg Your Dodgers are currently kicking my Cubs' collective ass 
@BlG_AL sorry mum.  insomnia's all down to temptation, not stress, I never realised that...
just saw Angels and Demons last night, quality flick-I think I liked it better than the first movie...but sleepy at work this am 
@ecuatorigringa AL!!!!!!! I miss you so much, you've been out of my life for too long. 
Ahh back in Sheboygan! Dodged a barrel, 3 sheets of plywood &amp; a tire! Couldn't dodge Dodger win though  It was an ugly game but gr8 time!
.... crap.   I'm sick.  Cubs in 2 days.  
I was excited to watch the Brew Crew vs. Marlins game tonight with @chi_rem until I realized Suppan was pitching.  Guaranteed loss. 
is sad. The Yankees lost to the Indians on their third 'match' by 4-5. 
Seriously bummed out over Beckett's hair. I really hope it grows back as pretty as it was before 
Just got home and I missed most of the Yankees game 
Putz can drive one to drink... The Schoenweis of 2009.... 
@carlmayer and I'm not so happy with the Tribe right now either!! 
Dodgers waste another lead off 
Dodgers r losing  ......
Just watched a Mariners game. We lost  Really want a Ichiro jersey in white or grey.
The move-in process has begun. Spending the first night in the apartment, class in the morning. Saw Angels/Demons, kinda disappointed 
J Cub's turn to hibernate. 
Mariners game was awesome..To bad they lost 
@belgort No   And I found out I had two so-called &quot;friends&quot; that went to DMB at Fenway and didn't invite me!
Gujjuland is showing Angels n Demons in hindi every where... 
That makes Rox sound like a decrepid old woman - she's my dog 
Yay Kots is off the DL!  But he's still with the stinky Sox.  Wish he was an A.
Is there a particular reason Ellsbury was dropped to 8th in the order? 
I'm so frustrated because the Dream Angels bra is on sale at VS and I can't afford to shop right now!  Apparently I'm easily frustrated.
Sox lost    damn it's almost 10...time is flying tonight
Just got done hanging with the wife and the G-Rents. Royals lost again.            Getting ready for bed!
The wegmens' ballpark is still new. But there's nothing interesting.  citifield and Yankee stadium are much better.
Oh boy, here comes the Dbacks bullpen 
Bigtime Dodgers win!  The Nyquil is doing it's work, I got to go to the courthouse tomorrow 
@xenoabe sounds like the replay of the game I was at last month... and Marmol dropped it this time around. 
Oh, the Cubs are causing me heartache...again. 
my bugaboo bee recalled. NL's #1 export lets me down.    http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml09/09233.html
Oh, the Cubs are causing me heartache...again.  
@GeoffSurratt  If there's one thing Cubs fans know...it's how to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory 
@Revs_R grahak or upbhogta ... which makes b8r sense? parichay ... limited in scope  sambandh too ... need not be a literal translation
Hoping the Sox get the game in tonight, but  not looking good 
Price vs. Sabathia tonight.. Wishin i was actually back in NY so I could watch  Lets go Yanks
Sad Angels and Kings is closed due to shadiness. I wanted to go there for my bday. 
What do I do when the Yankee game gets cancelled? 
Rays at Yanks rained out tonight 
Yankee game got canceled 
I'm dying with no Yankee game tonight 
Zack Greinke .... no.... 
WTF, #Whitesox??? 3-0 Indians winning. 
Watching the Marlins game, we are loosing 2-0 
So sad  MLB &gt;&gt; Greinke's long homerless streak ends http://kl.am/yMq (via @RoyalsMLB)
not looking like a good night for the Sox 
Oh, boo.  Oh, well, great pitching by both Santana and Verlander tonight. We will not mention Rodney.
watching the Sox lose to Texas 
i feel so torn....the rangers beat the red sox

Kubel destroyed that, how unfair 
gr8 Dodger game on rite now. But unfortunately the Dodgers just gave up a run    Phillies lead 3-2
congrats @pedro_munoz  on the win. Ichiro strikes out. M's lose. Ichiro's streak ends at 27 games. 
Not just one disappointment tonight, but two... M's lose 2-1 to Twins in 10 and Ichiro's hit streak ends at 27. 
@REDSOXpeeps Tonight was my first Redsox game I wish they won 
Sox lost 6-0 AND no sight of sizemore 
I love MLB.tv to catch the the Phillies but not tonight.  Freakin Dodgers get couple lucky breaks with two out and pull out a win.
Getting samosas, pakora, and drinks at Maharaja... Mariners lost in 10th. 
Damn.. Red Sox defeated by Texas Rangers at Fenway park..! 
basking in the glory of my Jumbotron debut tonight at the Padres game! woohoo! too bad the home team lost 8-0 
@Revs_R i missed it      ponga ya

@xxxSupermodel Yanks down 3-1 bottom of the 6th 
Watching the Reds!!!! Wishing Joey Votto was play!!! 
This is a bad BAD Cubs team.  Breaks my cold little heart.... 
Looks like #Yanks send another well pitched game down the drain  Where is all the offensive power gone?
Just finished a really great game between Yankees and the rays,we suffer a loss though 
Angels and Demons- 3* s I expected more than that.. 
What I meant was, Angels &amp; Demons = two thumbs up. Zensify &amp; ampersand = 
red sox lost   . heading back to deerfield
Reds just gave the Cubs another chance ... 
No rainout, but Cards lost 
Cubs just won 
@jeremycade You saw Angels &amp; Demons and it sucked? The book was a bit far fetched (time lines) but I thought the visuals would be cool. 
@alexandrakor I know...  lol no, when you're on the DL you don't have to. there's actually an MLB rule that says you're not allowed to...
@Caitcaitylin They suck. The Padres will fall to dead last and have the worst record in the Majors ... wait and see . ... Pitiful 
It might be time to give up on the Braves this season and start looking to the next season 
I can't find my sox. 
@julito77  How are ya? I heard that Josh Beckett hit a HR despite the fact my Red  Sox lost 
~~**~~ Boston Red Sox Fans are rude and uncivilized ~~**~~ 
... I'm going to get so wet going to Cubs 
Definitely suffering from the Mean Reds. 
Watching the Brewers bite it. 
Woulnd'tcha know? I have to work the day of the Astros Stitch n Pitch game. It's too dang hot anyway... 
@SEA_Mariners Just got back from Denver! Too bad they lost  But I got to meet Batista and  Ardsma which was really neat!
Watching the Indians play the Brewers. DeRo should totally still be playing for the Cubs 
Drillers losing to Naturals 6-3 in the bottom of the 8th inning. 
No Astros game tonight...  And no college class tomorrow as it is canceled! Just only gym and maybe seeing Taking of Pelham 1, 2, 3 :O
It doesn't appear to be Zito's night. 
crying because the Cleveland Indians make me so sad 
Finally Bochy yanks Zito...what a waste of $$$...Giants trade the bum for a couple big bats...PLEASE!!! 
@rhidown  so i guess you hate Indians 
@Pixel_Pirates ahhh cool. wish i'd taken part in dare to be digital when i was a student 
Trop de query_posts tue le query_posts 
This stinks.. I don't think they're televising the Cubs game on the east coast today. 
keith's vacation in OR is over   good thing we are leaving to the Phils this sat.  it'll make the ~3mos of separation more bearable.
Yay! I'm going to the Dodger game...I just don't know if I have tickets yet 
Home from work, tired, sick, and cranky  It's been a long day...Gonna relax tonight and watch my Marlins at Fenway. Volstad vs. Wakefield.
Watching my Sox, because they're the only men I can rely on at this point 
Thanks MASN, no Yankee game due to local blackout 
Is not going to the Twins game as originally planned 
Is not going to the Twins game as originally planned  #fb

Reds rain delay 
Volstad = not very studly tonight 
watching Sox/Cubs game. pleeeaseee rain, stop 
Stupid rain caused the Cubs/Sox game to be rained out 
No Cubs/Sox game tonight 
I Guess the Sox were too scared to play us... Game cancelled 
Sox-Cubs rained out.  in Chicago, IL http://loopt.us/bBOAlw.t
The bartender @ EP wasn't going to serve me because I had on my Cubs hat &amp; he said I looked like I was 12 
Tigers are sucking it up 
Ooops, got half way to the airport and found out Esther was already inside     Cubs / Sox game!

4-3 Yankees. Thanks Cano! Top of the eighth, CC is still in, Jeter has been taken out of the game 
sox game cancelled  out for some dollar drafts
After driving 8 hours I drive another 30 mins to go home to find out there's a Yankee Game so no parking until 1030 
Verlander is not having a good game! 
@lennysyankees Jeter will retire early?! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! 
The Nationals can't pull out another one!    Yankees win 5 to 3
@billbeckett Beckett??? where are you?? I found sisky but not you 
Have tix for the Cub/Sox today and it rained out 
Stros aren't doing to well... 
I guess Madson caught a case of the Lidgies 
So yeah, my Phillies are in trouble tonight...   
@Maureen12683 Yes,,,unfortunately @ebassman is a Sox fan...and unfortunately I can't rub in a Cubs win 2night since they cancelled 
Bases loaded and our pitcher came up to bat...and boo  he struck out...
5-0 makes me sick  wish the  Padres start winning!
Gah I'm so damn bored! everyone is sleeping...and the anger of the PPD Cubs Vs. Sox game is keeping me up! 
@mguic I dropped it when the Yankees scored and it says lens error everytime I try to turn it on 
looking forward to going to the Cards game 2night.  So far I am 0-2  Opening day=lost, Cards Cubs=lost, so 2night I think=WIN
Off to work  , then Cubs game tomorrow 
Another historic day at Fenway  by former Gov. Dukakis http://is.gd/14vKc Congrats Red Sox... still have yet to go to a game this summer 
I just turned down a ticket to Cubs/Sox because there's no way I'd finish a work project on time if I go. 
@KirstieLove @AL_AL_AL I don't have much holiday time left, no summer trips for me 
@AL_AL_AL Aw man that sounds so good!  I went to Newquay last year and I so want to do it again  Maybe just a long weekend this year 
Ugh...  #Cubs/Sox game on WGN, but with the Sox announcers.  
Cubs down two runs already. In 2009 parlance, this is an unsurmountable lead. 
is going to see Angels and Demons...really tired tho... 
@ddlovato im not :/ .. i would go to one if you were coming to AL 
Sox win  still a good time in wrigleyville after the game though  http://yfrog.com/5jpmaj
@wilw There was a time that no one ever considered Sosa using steroids...  This is one big reason that I do not watch MLB anymore.  
Once again The Cubs disappoint 
232 Games and Ellsbury makes the 1st error of his career 
@swarheit I said the same thing about Verlander before last night's game. 
@YsMum It's odd.  I usually see the Jays and Woodpeckers around...but nothing at all this year. Not even at Reifel 
@anikadanae My day was good, It could have been better if the Yankees would have won  What R U up2 2night, whats 4 din din? ? ?
Yanks lost to the Nationals? How embarrassing and frustrating!!! 
Yankees lost to the Nationals,3-2  
Yankees lost to the Nationals,3-2  
watching Astros game and suffering. 
Meanwhile, Dodgers are down 0-2.  
In the last 26 games, the Cubs have scored one run or less 10 times. This is not our century - again. 
Tigers lost.  But Granderson did well tonight!

@Vogelsong je viens de voir thanks ! #boulot 
The Tribe score 4 runs in the bottom of the 9th to tie the game, but then lose by 1 run in the 11th &amp; get swept by the Brewers. 
@doogie466 Rainy is right! Looks like the Phils will definitely be rained out 
Seeing my Cubs-Sox game day go down the drain ... with the rain! Boooh! 
Cub run with sammers before she leaves for richmond 
Hoping it will stop raining before the Yankee game starts 
thank you @armernathan and i was at the Meche game that night, pretty cool day all around, im sorry about your trip to the K last night 
Oh Raul.  You and Halladay both with groin injuries?  Have fun with Reyes and Hamilton on my bench/DL while I tank in the standings.  
@researchgoddess In that case, MLB prolly has lawyers searching tweets 
I hope the  Angels sweep the dodgers!! All games are sold out  i would do ANYTHING to go to those games

No W for the Empower Rangers this session 
the Sox game was cut short by the rain.  am on my way home. ain't gonna wait in the pouring rain despite the fact that my raincoat rules.
#redsox @the Sox Marlins game...raining 
Defenition of embarassment : the Yankees getting shut out by the Washington Nationals. We are not amused 
@AmalieBenjamin I hate rain-shortened Sox losses 
M Braves are in serious need of a win! 7 game losing streak 
@IanMBrowne I love that song, but I'm glad I'm not there. I guess the Sox aren't caring about reporters and their deadlines 
Put back the broom. Cards lost to the Tigers 6-3. 
what the hell is up with my Yankees? where is the offense? 
@ST_L_Cardinals I hope Pineiro is okay and that's it's nothing major. 
might be unlucky...I have been to 8 Cards games and have only seen 3 wins... 
i just found out the my kitty is retarded..litterally  poor little Dodger
These Seattle Mariners are breaking my heart! 
@kissatlanta @automaticpanic @thedbc @theerealfdhc @Afflictedwolf i miss my boppers  where u at?!?
@nova_caine unfortnately the Yanks and us Brits are too apathetic to give a shit about the country they live in 
going to the Sox-Braves game tonight...no one to root for  But hanging w/ some awesome chicks and one great guy!
i can't believe the Yankees got shutout and lost 2 of 3 to the Nationals.The blankety blank Washington Nationals!!!     
@BPLewis @BrianOSh suggested I intro myself; we have a lot in common, esp. given the Yanks poor performance this week 
@serescobar i left my phone in Angels car and he went to work...  
@creativitis Rays weren't WS-champs though.  i wish....    plus the Rays have been pretty avg this year. (in AL east standards at least)
Cubs R delayed   damit........
@BloggingBombers I was so happy the Yankees dealt Lilly for him 
depressed looking at the Pirates 1st round draft picks since '04...1 in the MLB???? and not one has a BA over .250 or ERA below 4.00  sad
Wow, the Cubs are SO not makin it happen this year  
Ugh. Cubs v. Indians started but not on the VTS WGN channel 
Tired myself out. Nap time. Fall asleep 2 the Cubs game &amp; hopefully dream of em winning cause it doesn't look like its gonna happen 2day 
@choppers89 Nah..they went down Mariners, couldn't be bugged to walk! I need Series 3 badly... 
@anthony_Rox awww whats wroung buddikins 
Ten minutes into the Sox game and already Daisuke isn't doing so well.  This first inning is awful.  
I am getting the iphone tonight! Haha but I can't use it 'till monday cuz i'm in AL 
Wait, what? Cubs 8, Indians 7 in 10 innings. Stop teasing! So glad i missed the bloody game!  http://tinyurl.com/n5bups I miss Wrigley 
I'm home! Already had a great meal ... if only the Sox could get it in gear 
I can't remember the last Yankee game I got to see 
car rides to AL are oh so long. 
I am enjoying the new beautiful KC Royals stadium but not so much the score of the game 
The Cardinals are losing to the Royals right now. I blame myself. 
On a second side note, the Sox are absolutely dying out at Fenway 
Ugh not looking good for the Sox  Getting ready to go over to my friends for some beer pong and beer bongs
If I have to watch that kind of #redsox game performance (or lack thereof), I'd rather not have MLB streaming video on my iphone anymore. 
kinda glad that we didnt go to Phillies game tonight... they lost... again... WTF is going on?!!! 
There's a Clemens jersey in here and it does not look as cool anymore. 
@ltspoonstick Haha, don't get too excited. The Yankees destroyed my boy Sean West tonight. 
I should really stop watching the Dodgers and go to sleep. It's 05:15 
24 pk Newcastle..  Angels vs Dodgers!  On tv 
The Tribe blow a 7-0 lead to the Cubs and lose 8-7?!! I'm feeling a migraine coming on. 
I guess the Dodgers didn't want me to put out  Stupid Angels!
No warm sun for you today @jabotello but at least your Angels won 
The Mariners' Endy Chavez (former Met) collided with the shortstop last night. Right knee. Manager says &quot;all indications are not good.&quot; 
@NickSwisher Great job Yanks - you have a tried and true Yankee fan in NH. Surrounded by Sox fans though 
Praying it doesn't rain for tomorrow's Red Sox / Braves game with my dad. Might put a damper on my Father's Day present 
ok i'm sooo having baseball withdrawls today... been weeks since i've been able to see my Braves play 
@batgirl2285 don't get blowd up 
Ughhh. I think the Phillies game will get rained out. 
I want to go home and go to a Cubs game at Wrigley!!!

Trying to bear another wet and dreary weekend in Philly. Saw Angels &amp; Demons and was disappointed 
first weekend without any hockey excitement...all we have now are the Pirates 
@BlG_AL just a knitted one. But it had a band of elastic and stayed on my head. And it was thick. And from M&amp;S. And mam bought me it. 
@erykamarie So don't hate me, but I'm totally jealous! I've always wanted to visit the old Yankee Stadium and they killed it 
Boo, I don't get the Marlins station in my room. I already moved everything in here. No more Yankees for me tonight. 
wonders how the Braves are doing since MLB blocked Peachtree TV from broadcasting the game. Dammit!!  
Just got home from Citifield!! Mets lost 
Orioles up 6-5 over Phils bottom of the 9th 
Watching the Phils lose another 1  
Phillies blow it again 
Twins? Not so winning tonite. 
@MLB I wish I could have heard/seen it.  But alas, no luck.  
Houston 6 9 0      Twins   5 8 0      end of the game. Crede hitting for tolbert. Runner on second. Just falls short of a homer. 
i can't believe the Yankees lost to the marlins tonight 
The dam Cardinals took for first place by 1/2 a game with their win vs Royals and Brewers loss 
Come on the Dodgers... can some one keep me informed on the Dodgers/Angles as i live in England and we don't get baseball here 
damn... I came to the wrong game LOL Dodgers are kicking butt!! 
So, I put on one of my Reds jerseys and then they lost, sadly, I do not bring good luck 
Padres game...can't enjoy it as much from this high up   http://twitpic.com/7z5jx
Angels didn't do well tonight 
Just watched the Angels and Demons movie.. they didn't show the Illuminati Diamond 
Phillies game was so fun, even though they lost. 
Washington Nationals win four straight!!!! I have to go for them for five with this 5-1 pitcher Ive never heard of. Sweeping the Jays 
I believed Angels and Demons would be a feel good till the last moment 
@lizzieboo77 Missed you horribly at Beckett's drinks..all work and no play still? 
@Dougiebaseball I wish you were still with the Yankees  I couldn't believe when they let you walk.
@siana_mia @bytor2112 @CityGirl912 I see your Sox won. I wish my baseball boys could figure out a win. 
Angels &amp; Demons is really lame! Ridiculous story, bad acting... who told me this was good again? 
i miss seeing @NickSwisher at Sox games 
2 hrs of lap swimming at the pool ... i feel good but the Vatican never showed up to take me to Rome  (Angels &amp; Demons)
@Lizzs_Lockeroom better not have been texting when u have that many ppls lives in ur hands! morons 
wondering how the guy is that had a seizure/heart attack next to me at the Florida Marlins game yesterday.  EMT took forever to respond 
Chief was suppose to be in the Little League parade 2mrow @ the Brewers/Twins game. Miller Stadium is flooded.  Hope it's still on.
The Tigers are tearing my heart out. 
Oh man  the Carter Twins play the opry on the 5th and we're going on the 9th. Dangit.
@gavski82 Wow! I've never heard of that one before! I love it! Figgy is good. I've not driven it for a few weeks now though... 
@TheRealMariners I was hoping after Griffey's PH HR that he would go up in the ranks, not down.    Good news for Ichiro, though.
@gourmetga only the Globe got the Beckett pic - our photog was wrapped before he showed up 
Video of Carter Twins and Stubbs of KMPS @PacSci  http://is.gd/1aDw7  Sorry about the audio.  But the Twins are COOL! They play at 12n.
@lynzcook Hey Lynz!  Cubs/Tigers is tough for me too!   Hope all is well in your neck of the woods.
@Knunez It doesn't help the sox are batting an AL worst .219 at home. 
Bats scare me

Ethier just hit a home run! That's my boy! 
What happened, did the Indians miss an extra point against Yankees? 
@RagsTwoRiches Let's hope the Rangers 5 game winning streak becomes a 7 game winnning Streak.  that would be awesome. 
@cmpinky61 well not exactly the same but it is in the ballpark 
I found Jeter too!!!!!! 
The #Yankees lose 22-4 to the #Indians. The Tribe put up 14 runs in the second inning, tying a club record. TAKE THAT YANKS! 
Going to the Jays game today

Having a great birthday. The Rangers are up 2-0 and the weather is beautiful 
@LaurelHarper And @squeakmouse73 is my friend who beads and sings and loves the Mariners and the Blazers and I forgot she was blind.

http://www.dothebouncy.com/smf - some shameless plugging for the best Rangers forum on earth 
Oops! Meant to say Boston Red Sox (instead of Red Sux) and Tampa Bay Rays (instead of Devil Rays) in previous post.. Old habits 
Baltimore beat the Yankees  @Ashley094
@albo60s you must ask the Cubs fans. I can't fathom it myself.
